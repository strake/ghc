This programme is intended to be used by any GHC developers working on Parser.y
or RdrHsSyn.hs, and who want to check that their changes do not break the API
Annotations.

It does a basic test that all annotations do make it to the final AST, and dumps
a list of the annotations generated for a given file, so that they can be
checked against the source being parsed for sanity.

This utility is also intended to be used in tests, so that when new features are
added the expected annotations are also captured.

Usage

In a test Makefile

  $(CHECK_API_ANNOTATIONS) "`'$(TEST_HC)' $(TEST_HC_OPTS) --print-libdir | tr -d '\r'`" FileToParse.hs

See examples in (REPO_HOME)/testsuite/tests/ghc-api/annotations/Makefile
