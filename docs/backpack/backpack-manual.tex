\title{The Backpack Manual}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\paragraph{What is this?}  This is an in-depth technical specification of
all of the new components associated with Backpack, a new module system
for Haskell.  This is \emph{not} a tutorial, and it assumes you are
familiar with the basic motivation and structure of Backpack.

\paragraph{How to read this manual}  This manual is split into three
sections, in dependency order.  The first section describes the new
features added to GHC, e.g., new compilation flags and input formats.
In principle, a user could take advantage of Backpack using just these
features, without using Cabal or cabal-install; thus, we describe it
first.  The next section describes the new features added to the library
Cabal, and the last section describes how cabal-install drives the
entire process.  A downside of this approach is that we start off by
describing low-level GHC features which are quite dissimilar from the
high-level Backpack interface, but we're not really trying to explain
Backpack to complete new users.  \Red{Red indicates features which are
not implemented yet.}

\section{GHC}

\subsection{Signatures}

An \texttt{hsig} file represents a (type) signature for a Haskell
module, containing type signatures, data declarations, type classes,
type class instances, but not value definitions.\footnote{Signatures are
the backbone of the Backpack module system.  A signature can be used to
type-check client code which uses a module (without the module
implementation), or to verify that an implementation upholds some
signature (without a client implementation.)} The syntax of an
\texttt{hsig} file is similar to an \texttt{hs-boot} file.  Here is an
example of a module signature representing an abstract map type:

\begin{verbatim}
type role Map nominal representational
data Map k v
instance Functor (Map k)
empty :: Map k a
\end{verbatim}

An \texttt{hsig} file can either be type-checked or compiled against some
\emph{backing implementation}, an \texttt{hs} module which provides all
of the declarations that a signature advertises.

\paragraph{Typechecking} A signature file can be type-checked in the same
way as an ordinary Haskell file:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ghc -c Map.hsig -fno-code -fwrite-interface
\end{verbatim}

This procedure generates an interface file, which can be used to type
check other modules which depend on the signature, even if no backing
implementation is available.  By default, this generated interface file
is given \emph{fresh} original names for everything in the signature.
For example, if \texttt{data T} is defined in two signature files
\texttt{A.hsig} and \texttt{B.hsig}, they would not be considered
type-equal, and could not be used interconvertibly, even if they
had the same structure.

\begin{color}{red}
To explicitly specify what original name should be assigned (e.g.,
to make the previous example type-equal) the \texttt{-shape-of} flag
can be used:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ghc -c Map.hsig -shape-of "Map is containers_KEY:Data.Map.Map" \
    -fno-code -fwrite-interface
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{-shape-of} is comma separated list of \texttt{name is origname}
entries, where \texttt{name} is an unqualified name and
\texttt{origname} is an original name, of the form
\texttt{package\_KEY:Module.name}, where \texttt{package\_KEY} is a
package key identifying the origin of the identifier (or a fake
identifier for a symbol whose provenance is not known).  Each instance
of \texttt{origname} in the signature is instead assigned the original
name \texttt{origname}, instead of the default original name.

(TODO: This interface will work pretty poorly with \texttt{--make})
\end{color}

\paragraph{Compiling} We can specify a backing implementation for
a signature and compile the signature against it using the
\texttt{-sig-of} flag:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ghc -c Map.hsig -sig-of "package_KEY:Module"
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{-sig-of} flag takes as an argument a module, specified
as a package key, a colon, and then the module name.  \Red{This module
must be a proper, \texttt{exposed-module}, and not a reexport or
signature.}

Compilation of a signature entails two things.  First, a consistency
check is performed between the signature and the backing
implementation, ensuring that the implementation accurately implements
all of the types in the signature.  For every declaration in the
signature, there must be an equivalent one in the backing implementation
with an identical type (this check is quite similar to the one used
for \texttt{hs-boot}).  Second, an interface file is generated
which reexports the set of identifiers from the backing
implementation that were specified in the signature. A file which
imports the signature will use this interface file.\footnote{This
interface file is similar to a module which reexports identifiers
from another module, except that we also record the backing implementation
for the purpose of handling imports, described in the next section.}

\subsection{Extended format in the installed package database}

After a set of Haskell modules has been compiled, they can be registered
in the installed package database so that their exposed modules and
signatures can be made available for import using the \texttt{-package}
flag.  An entry in the installed package database specifies what modules
and signatures from the package itself are exposed. It can also
re-export modules and signatures from other packages.\footnote{Signature
reexports are essential for creating signature packages in a modular
way; module reexports are very useful for backwards-compatibility
packages and also taking an package that has been instantiated multiple
ways and giving its modules unique names.}

There are three fields of an entry in the installed package database of note.

\begin{color}{red}

First, the \texttt{exposed-modules} field is a comma-separated list of
module names, possibly with two extra, optional pieces of information
about the module in question: what the \emph{original module/signature}
is (if it is a reexport)\footnote{Knowing the original module/signature
makes it possible for GHC to directly load the interface file, without
having to follow multiple hops in the package database.}, and what the
\emph{backing implementation} is (if it is a signature)\footnote{Knowing
the backing implementation makes it possible to tell if an import is
unambiguous without having to load the interface file first.}.

\begin{verbatim}
exposed-modules:
    A,                              # original module
    B from ipid:B,                  # reexported module
    C is ipid:CImpl,                # exposed signature
    D from ipid:D is ipid:DImpl,    # reexported signature
    D from ipid:D2 is ipid:DImpl    # duplicates can be OK
\end{verbatim}

If no reexports or signatures are used, the commas can be omitted
(making this syntax backwards compatible with the original syntax.)

Entries to the installed package database are registered using \texttt{ghc-pkg}.
\texttt{ghc-pkg} validates that all entries in \texttt{exposed-modules} are
unambiguous; the criterion for which we will establish in the next section.\footnote{Note
that this does mean duplicates can be allowed in some circumstances.  This is most useful
when combining multiple signatures together.}

TODO: What is currently implemented is
that \texttt{reexported-modules} has a seperate field, where the
original module is always set and backing implementation is always empty.
I came to this generalization when I found I needed to add support for
signatures and reexported signatures.  An alternate design is just to
have a separate list for every parameter: however, we end up with a lot
of duplication in the validation and handling code GHC side.  I do like
the parametric approach better, but since the original
\texttt{exposed-modules} was space separated, there's not an easy way to
extend the syntax in a backwards-compatible way.  The current proposal
suggests we add the comma variant because it is unambiguous with the old
syntax.
\end{color}

Second, the \texttt{instantiated-with} field records the \emph{original
module} which instantiated any holes associated with a package (i.e.,
what \texttt{-sig-of} parameter was used during compilation.)

Finally, the \texttt{key} field records the \emph{package key} of a
package.  A package key is an opaque identifier identifying a package
which serves as the basis for type identity and linker
symbols.\footnote{Informally, you might think of a package as a package
name and its version, e.g., \texttt{containers-0.9}; however, sometimes,
it is necessary to distinguish between installed instances of a package
with the same name and version which were compiled with different
dependencies.} \footnote{The package key is different from an
\emph{installed package ID}, which is a more fine-grained identifier for
a package.  Identical installed package IDs imply identical package
keys, but not vice versa.  However, within a single run of GHC, we
enforce that package keys and (non-shadowed) installed package IDs are
in one-to-one correspondence.}

The package key is programatically generated by Cabal\footnote{In
practice, a package key looks something like
\texttt{conta\_GtvvBIboSRuDmyUQfSZoAx}.  In this document, we'll use
\texttt{containers\_KEY} as a convenient shorthand to refer to some
package key for the \texttt{containers} package.}; while GHC has no say
in the generation process,  Cabal's must choose distinct package keys if
any of the following fields in the installed package database are
distinct:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{name} (e.g., \texttt{containers})
\item \texttt{version} (e.g., \texttt{0.8})
\item \texttt{depends} modulo package keys
\item \texttt{instantiated-with} modulo package keys
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Module thinning and renaming}

The \texttt{-package} flag and its variants (\texttt{-package-id} and
\texttt{-package-key}) now support ``thinning and renaming''
annotations, which allows a user to selectively expose only certain
modules from a package, possibly under different names.\footnote{This
feature has utility both with and without Backpack.  The ability to
rename modules makes it easier to deal with third-party packages which
export conflicting module names; under Backpack, this situation becomes
especially common when an indefinite package is instantiated multiple
time with different dependencies.}

The command line flag \texttt{-package pkgname} causes all
exposed modules of \texttt{pkgname} to become visible under their
original names for imports.  Thinning and renaming can be applied
using the extended syntax \texttt{-package "pkgname
(rns)"}, where \texttt{rns} is a comma separated list of
module renamings \texttt{OldName as NewName}.  Bare module names are
also accepted, where \texttt{Name} is shorthand for \texttt{Name as
Name}.  A package exposed this way only causes modules (specified before
the \texttt{as}) explicitly listed in the renamings to become visible
under their new names (specified after the \texttt{as}).  For example,
\texttt{-package "containers (Data.Set, Data.Map as Map)"} makes
\texttt{Data.Set} and \texttt{Map} (pointing to
\texttt{Data.Map}) available for import.\footnote{See also Cabal files
for a twist on this syntax.}

When the \texttt{-hide-all-packages} flag is applied, uses of the
\texttt{-package} flag are \emph{cumulative}; each argument is processed
and its bindings added to the global module map.  For example,
\texttt{-hide-all-packages -package containers -package "containers
(Data.Map as Map)"} brings both the default exposed modules of
containers and a binding for \texttt{Map} into scope.\footnote{The
previous behavior, and the current behavior when
\texttt{-hide-all-packages} is not set, is for a second package flag for
the same package name to override the first one.}\footnote{We defer
discussion of what happens when a module name is bound multiple times until
we have discussed signatures, which have interesting behavior on this front.}

\subsection{Disambiguating imports}

With module thinning and renaming, as well as the installed package
database, it is possible for GHC to have multiple bindings for a single
module name.  If the bindings are ambiguous, GHC will report an error
when the user attempts to use the identifier.

Define the \emph{true module} associated with a binding to be the
backing implementation, if the binding is for a signature,\footnote{This
implements signature merging, as otherwise, we would not necessarily
expect original signatures to be equal} and the original module
otherwise.  A binding is unambiguous if the true modules of all the
bindings are equal.  Here is an example of an unambiguous set of exposed
modules:

\begin{verbatim}
exposed-modules:
    A from pkg:AImpl,
    A is pkg:AImpl,
    A from other-pkg:Sig is pkg:AImpl
\end{verbatim}

This mapping says that this package reexports \texttt{pkg:AImpl} as
\texttt{A}, has an \texttt{A.hsig} which was compiled against
\texttt{pkg:AImpl}, and reexports a signature from \texttt{other-pkg}
which itself was compiled against \texttt{pkg:AImpl}.

Here are some more examples:

\begin{verbatim}
$ cat > AImpl.hsig
module AImpl where
    foo = 2
$ cat > ASig.hsig
module ASig where
    foo :: Int
$ cat > BSig.hsig
module BSig where
    foo :: Int
$ cat > Main.hs
module Main where
    import ASig
    import BSig
    main = print foo
$ ghc -c AImpl.hs
$ ghc -c ASig.hsig -sig-of "main:AImpl"
$ ghc -c BSig.hsig -sig-of "main:AImpl"
$ ghc -c Main.hs
SUCCEEDS

$ cat > BImpl.hs
module BImpl where
    foo = 4
$ ghc -c BImpl.hs
$ ghc -c BSig.hsig -sig-of "main:BImpl" # recompile
$ ghc -c Main.hs
FAILS due to ambiguous original name
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Typechecking}  \Red{When typechecking only, there is not
necessarily a backing implementation associated with a signature.  In
this case, even if the original names match up, we must perform an
\emph{additional} check to ensure declarations have compatible types.}
This check is not necessary during compilation, because \texttt{-sig-of}
will ensure that the signatures are compatible with a common, unique
backing implementation.

\begin{color}{red}
\begin{verbatim}
$ ghc -c ASig.hsig -fno-code -fwrite-interface
$ ghc -c BSig.hsig -fno-code -fwrite-interface
$ ghc -c Main.hs -fno-code -fwrite-interface
FAILS due to ambiguous original name (default used)

$ ghc -c ASig.hsig -shape-of "foo is main:AImpl" -fno-code -fwrite-interface
$ ghc -c BSig.hsig -shape-of "foo is main:AImpl" -fno-code -fwrite-interface

    foo :: Bool

$ ghc -c Main.hs -fno-code -fwrite-interface

\section{Cabal}

\subsection{Reexports and signatures}

The Cabal file is a user-facing description of a package, which is
processed into an \texttt{InstalledPackageInfo} by Cabal.  Currently,
package authors use \texttt{exposed-modules} in the \texttt{library}
section to specify what \texttt{hs} modules are available for import
when the package is exposed.  Backpack extends the Cabal files with four
new fields:

\paragraph{reexported-modules}  A comma-separated list of module or
signature reexports.  It is represented in the installed package
database as an module with a non-empty original module/signature: the
original module is resolved by Cabal.  There are three valid syntactic
forms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Orig}, which reexports any module with the
    name \texttt{Orig} in the current scope (e.g.,
    as specified by \texttt{build-depends}).

    \item \texttt{Orig as New}, which reexports a module with
    the name \texttt{Orig} in the current scope.  \texttt{Orig}
    can be a home module and doesn't necessarily have to come
    from \texttt{build-depends}.

    \item \texttt{package:Orig as New}, which reexports a module
    with name \texttt{Orig} from the specific source package \texttt{package}.
\end{itemize}

If multiple modules with the same name are in scope, we check
if it is unambiguous (the same check used by GHC); if they are
we reexport all of the modules; otherwise, we give an error.
In this way, packages which reexport multiple signatures to the
same name can be valid; a package may also reexport a signature
onto a home \texttt{hsig} signature.

\paragraph{required-signatures}  A space-separated list of module names
specifying internal signatures (in \texttt{hsig} files) of the package.
This field is analogous to \texttt{other-modules}, but with signatures.
Signatures specified in this field can be imported by other home
modules, but are not registered in the installed package database and
available for external import.  In order for this package to be
compiled, implementations for all these signatures must be provided (see
the section on \texttt{Setup}).

\paragraph{exposed-signatures}  A space-separated list of module names
specifying externally visible signatures (in \texttt{hsig} files) of the package.  It is
represented in the installed package database as a module with a
non-empty backing implementation.  Signatures exposed in this way are
available external import.  In order for this package to be compiled,
implementations for all these signatures must be provided (see the
section on \texttt{Setup}).

\paragraph{indefinite}  A package is \emph{indefinite} if it has any
\texttt{required-signatures} or \texttt{exposed-signatures}, or it
transitively depends on an indefinite package whose signatures have
not been instantiated.  In principle, this parameter can be calculated
by Cabal, but serves a documentory purpose for packages which do not
have any signatures themselves, but depend on packages which do (without
providing implementations for those signatures.)

\subsection{Package key generation}

The algorithm Cabal uses in order to calculate what 

\subsection{build-depends}

This field has been extended with new syntax
to provide the access to GHC's new thinning and renaming functionality
and to have the ability to include an indefinite package \emph{multiple times}
(with different instantiations for its holes).  Renaming is the
\emph{primary} mechanism by which holes are instantiated in a mix-in module
system, however, this instantiation only occurs when running \texttt{cabal-install}.

Here is an example entry in \texttt{build-depends}: \texttt{foo >= 0.8
(ASig as A1, B as B1; ASig as A2, ...)}.  This statement includes the
package \texttt{foo} twice, once with \texttt{ASig} instantiated with
\texttt{A1} and \texttt{B} renamed as \texttt{B1}, and once with
\texttt{ASig} instantiated with \texttt{A2}, and all other modules
imported with their original names.  Assuming that the key of the first
instance of \texttt{foo} is \texttt{foo\_KEY1} and the key of the second instance
is \texttt{foo\_KEY2}, and that \texttt{ASig} is an \texttt{exposed-signature}, then this \texttt{build-depends} would turn into
these flags for GHC: \texttt{-package-key "foo\_KEY1 (ASig as A1, B as B1)" -package-key "foo\_KEY2" -package-key "foo\_KEY2 (ASig as A2)"}

Syntactically, the thinnings and renamings are placed inside a
parenthetical after the package name and version constraints.
Semicolons distinguish separate inclusions of the package, and the inner
comma-separated lists indicate the thinning/renamings of the module.
You can also write \texttt{...}, which simply
includes all of the default bindings from the package.
\Red{This is not implemented. Should this only refer to modules which were not referred to already? Should it refer only to holes?}

There are two marks that should be made about separate instantiations of
the package.  First, Cabal will automatically ``de-duplicate'' instances of
the package which are equivalent: thus, \texttt{foo (A; B)} is equivalent to
\texttt{foo (A, B)} when \texttt{foo} is a definite package, or
