Release notes for version 8.0.2
===============================

TODO FIXME

Highlights
----------

TODO FIXME.

Full details
------------

Language
~~~~~~~~

-  TODO FIXME.

-  :ghc-flag:`-XStaticPointers` now allows the body of the ``static`` form to
   refer to closed local bindings. For instance, this is now permitted:
   ``f = static x where x = 'a'``.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

-  TODO FIXME.

-  The :ghc-flag:`-ddump-cmm` now dumps the result after C-- pipeline pass. Two
   more flags were added: :ghc-flag:`-ddump-cmm-from-stg` to allow to get the
   initial cmm from STG-to-C-- code generation and :ghc-flag:`-ddump-cmm-verbose`
   to obtain the intermediates from all C-- pipeline stages.

Template Haskell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Reifying types that contain unboxed tuples now works correctly. (Previously,
   Template Haskell reified unboxed tuples as boxed tuples with twice their
   appropriate arity.)

TODO FIXME Heading title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  GHCi now supports two new commands. :ghci-cmd:`:type` ``+d`` performs
   defaulting on the type before reporting it to the user, and
   :ghci-cmd:`:type` ``+v`` refrains from instantiating any variables before
   reporting, which is useful in concert with :ghc-flag:`-XTypeApplications`.
