Release notes for version 8.0.2
===============================

TODO FIXME

Highlights
----------

TODO FIXME.

Full details
------------

Language
~~~~~~~~

-  TODO FIXME.

-  :ghc-flag:`-XStaticPointers` now allows the body of the ``static`` form to
   refer to closed local bindings. For instance, this is now permitted:
   ``f = static x where x = 'a'``.

TODO FIXME Heading title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  GHCi now supports two new commands. :ghci-cmd:`:type` ``+d`` performs
   defaulting on the type before reporting it to the user, and
   :ghci-cmd:`:type` ``+v`` refrains from instantiating any variables before
   reporting, which is useful in concert with :ghc-flag:`-XTypeApplications`.

   .. code-block:: none

	*X> :type +d length

	*X> :set -fprint-explicit-foralls
	*X> :type length
	length :: forall {a} {t :: * -> *}. Foldable t => t a -> Int
	*X> :type +v length
	length :: forall (t :: * -> *). Foldable t => forall a. t a -> Int
