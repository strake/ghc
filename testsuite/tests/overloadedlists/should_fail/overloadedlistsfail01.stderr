overloadedlistsfail01.hs:5:8: error:
    Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘print’
    prevents the constraint ‘(Show a0)’ from being solved.
    Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
    These potential instances exist:
      instance [safe] Show Version -- Defined in ‘Data.Version’
      instance Show Module -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      ...plus 26 others
      (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
    In the expression: print [1]
    In an equation for ‘main’: main = print [1]

overloadedlistsfail01.hs:5:14: error:
    Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from an overloaded list
    prevents the constraint ‘(IsList a0)’ from being solved.
    Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
    These potential instances exist:
      instance IsList Version -- Defined in ‘GHC.Exts’
      instance IsList [a] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Exts’
    In the first argument of ‘print’, namely ‘[1]’
    In the expression: print [1]
    In an equation for ‘main’: main = print [1]

overloadedlistsfail01.hs:5:15: error:
    Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from the literal ‘1’

      instance Num Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Num’
      instance Num Double -- Defined in ‘GHC.Float’
