bkp36.bkp:20:16: warning: [-Wdeprecations (in -Wdefault)]
    In the use of type constructor or class ‘T’ (imported from B):
    "Inherited requirements from non-signature libraries (libraries with modules) should not be used, as this mode of use is not compatible with PVP-style version bounds.  Instead, copy the declaration to the local hsig file or move the signature to a library of its own and add that library as a dependency."
