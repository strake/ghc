bkpfail04.bkp:7:9: error:
    Type constructor ‘A’ has conflicting definitions in the module
    and its hsig file
    Main module: data A = A {foo :: GHC.Types.Int}
    Hsig file:  data A = A {bar :: GHC.Types.Bool}
    The constructors do not match:
      The record label lists for ‘A’ differ
      The types for ‘A’ differ
