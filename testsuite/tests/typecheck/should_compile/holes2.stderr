holes2.hs:3:5: warning:
    Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘show’
    prevents the constraint ‘(Show a0)’ from being solved.
    Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
    These potential instances exist:
      instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      instance Show Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      instance Show a => Show (Maybe a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      ...plus 22 others
      (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
    In the expression: show _
    In an equation for ‘f’: f = show _

holes2.hs:3:10: warning:
    Found hole: _ :: a0
    Where: ‘a0’ is an ambiguous type variable
    Relevant bindings include f :: String (bound at holes2.hs:3:1)
    In the first argument of ‘show’, namely ‘_’
    In the expression: show _
    In an equation for ‘f’: f = show _
