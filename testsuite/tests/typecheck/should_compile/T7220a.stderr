    Could not deduce (C a b)
    from the context: (C a0 b, TF b ~ Y)
      bound by the type signature for: f :: (C a0 b, TF b ~ Y) => b
      at T7220a.hs:17:6-44
    Possible fix:
      add (C a b) to the context of
        the type signature for: f :: (C a0 b, TF b ~ Y) => b
    In the ambiguity check for the type signature for ‘f’:
      f :: forall a. (forall b. (C a b, TF b ~ Y) => b) -> X
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‘f’:
      f :: (forall b. (C a b, TF b ~ Y) => b) -> X
