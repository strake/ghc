    Could not deduce (SomeFun x ~ SomeFun y)

    NB: ‘SomeFun’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    Expected type: Proxy (SomeFun x) -> Proxy y -> ()
      Actual type: Proxy (SomeFun y) -> Proxy y -> ()
    In the ambiguity check for:
      forall (x :: Nat) (y :: Nat).
      (x <= y, y <= x) =>
      Proxy (SomeFun x) -> Proxy y -> ()
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‘ti7’:
      ti7 :: (x <= y, y <= x) => Proxy (SomeFun x) -> Proxy y -> ()
