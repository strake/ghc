T8034.hs:6:3: error:
    Couldn't match type ‘F a0’ with ‘F a’
    NB: ‘F’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: F a -> F a
      Actual type: F a0 -> F a0
    In the ambiguity check for the type signature for ‘foo’:
      foo :: forall a. C a => F a -> F a
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    When checking the class method: foo :: forall a. C a => F a -> F a
    In the class declaration for ‘C’
