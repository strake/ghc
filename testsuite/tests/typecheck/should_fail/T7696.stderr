    Couldn't match kind ‘* -> *’ with ‘*’
    When matching types
      t0 :: (* -> *) -> *
      w :: * -> *
    Expected type: ((), w ())
      Actual type: (m0 a0, t0 m0)
    Relevant bindings include f2 :: ((), w ()) (bound at T7696.hs:7:1)
    In the expression: f1
    In an equation for ‘f2’: f2 = f1
