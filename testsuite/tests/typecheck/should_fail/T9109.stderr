    • Couldn't match expected type ‘t1’ with actual type ‘Bool’
        ‘t1’ is untouchable
          inside the constraints: t ~ Bool
          bound by a pattern with constructor: GBool :: G Bool,
                   in an equation for ‘foo’
          at T9109.hs:8:5-9
      ‘t1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of foo :: G t -> t1 at T9109.hs:8:1
      Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘foo’
    • In the expression: True
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo GBool = True
    • Relevant bindings include
        foo :: G t -> t1 (bound at T9109.hs:8:1)
