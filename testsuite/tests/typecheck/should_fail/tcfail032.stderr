    Couldn't match expected type ‘a1 -> Int’ with actual type ‘t’
      because type variable ‘a1’ would escape its scope
    This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
      an expression type signature: Eq a1 => a1 -> Int
      at tcfail032.hs:14:8-30
    In the expression: (x :: (Eq a) => a -> Int)
    In an equation for ‘f’: f x = (x :: (Eq a) => a -> Int)
    Relevant bindings include
      x :: t (bound at tcfail032.hs:14:3)
      f :: t -> a -> Int (bound at tcfail032.hs:14:1)
