    Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘Bool’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for: f :: a -> [a] at tcfail153.hs:5:6
    Expected type: [a]
      Actual type: [Bool]
    Relevant bindings include
      x :: a (bound at tcfail153.hs:6:3)
      f :: a -> [a] (bound at tcfail153.hs:6:1)
    In the expression: g x
    In an equation for ‘f’:
        f x
          = g x
          where
              g y = if y then [] else [...]
