    Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘Bool’
    ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
    the type signature for:
      f :: forall a. a -> [a]
    at tcfail153.hs:5:6
    Expected type: [a]
      Actual type: [Bool]
    In the expression: g x
    In an equation for ‘f’:
        f x
          = g x
          where
              g y = if y then [] else [...]
    Relevant bindings include
      x :: a (bound at tcfail153.hs:6:3)
      f :: a -> [a] (bound at tcfail153.hs:6:1)
