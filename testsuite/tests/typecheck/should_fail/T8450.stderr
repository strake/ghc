    Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘()’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for run :: a at T8450.hs:7:15
    Relevant bindings include run :: a (bound at T8450.hs:8:1)
    In the expression: runEffect $ (undefined :: Either a ())
    In an equation for ‘run’:
        run = runEffect $ (undefined :: Either a ())
