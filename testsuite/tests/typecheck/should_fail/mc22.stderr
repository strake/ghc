    No instance for (Functor t1) arising from a use of ‘fmap’
    Possible fix:
      add (Functor t1) to the context of
        a type expected by the context: (a -> b) -> t1 a -> t1 b
        or the inferred type of foo :: t (t1 [Char])
    In the expression: fmap
    In a stmt of a monad comprehension: then group using take 5
    In the expression:
      [x + 1 | x <- ["Hello", "World"], then group using take 5]

mc22.hs:10:26:
    Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘t1 a’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          a type expected by the context: [a] -> t (t1 a) at mc22.hs:10:9
    Expected type: [a] -> t (t1 a)
      Actual type: [a] -> [a]
    Relevant bindings include
      foo :: t (t1 [Char]) (bound at mc22.hs:8:1)
    In the expression: take 5
    In a stmt of a monad comprehension: then group using take 5
