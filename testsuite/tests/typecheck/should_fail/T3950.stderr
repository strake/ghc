    Couldn't match kind ‘* -> *’ with ‘*’
    When matching types
      w :: (* -> * -> *) -> *
      Sealed :: (* -> *) -> *
    Expected type: w (Id p)
      Actual type: Sealed (Id p0 x0)
    Relevant bindings include
      rp :: Bool -> Maybe (w (Id p)) (bound at T3950.hs:15:1)
    In the first argument of ‘Just’, namely ‘rp'’
    In the expression: Just rp'
