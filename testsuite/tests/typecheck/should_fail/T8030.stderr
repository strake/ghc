T8030.hs:9:3: error:
    Couldn't match expected type ‘Pr a’ with actual type ‘Pr a0’
    NB: ‘Pr’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    In the ambiguity check for the type signature for ‘op1’:
      op1 :: forall (k :: BOX) (a :: k). C a => Pr a
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    When checking the class method:
      op1 :: forall (k :: BOX) (a :: k). C a => Pr a
    In the class declaration for ‘C’
