    Type family equation violates injectivity annotation.
    Injective kind variable ‘k’ is not inferable from the RHS type variables.
    In the RHS of type family equation:
      forall (k :: BOX) (a :: k) (b :: k). Gc a b = Int
    In the equations for closed type family ‘Gc’
    In the type family declaration for ‘Gc’
