    • Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘m Bool’
      Expected type: t1 -> m Bool
        Actual type: t1 -> Bool
    • The function ‘f1’ is applied to one argument,
      its type is ‘m0 Bool’,
      it is specialized to ‘t1 -> Bool’
      In the expression: f1 undefined
      In an equation for ‘f2’: f2 = f1 undefined
    • Relevant bindings include f2 :: m Bool (bound at T9605.hs:7:1)
