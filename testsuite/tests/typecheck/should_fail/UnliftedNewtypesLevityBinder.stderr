    Cannot use function with levity-polymorphic arguments:
      IdentC :: a -> Ident a
    (Note that levity-polymorphic primops such as 'coerce' and unboxed tuples
    are eta-expanded internally because they must occur fully saturated.
    Use -fprint-typechecker-elaboration to display the full expression.)
    Levity-polymorphic arguments: a :: TYPE r
