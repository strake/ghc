    No instance for (Show s0) arising from a use of ‘show’
    The type variable ‘s0’ is ambiguous
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance Show Zero -- Defined at tcfail133.hs:8:29
      instance Show One -- Defined at tcfail133.hs:9:28
      instance (Show a, Show b, Number a, Digit b) => Show (a :@ b)
        -- Defined at tcfail133.hs:11:54
      ...plus 26 others
    In the expression: show
    In the expression: show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
    In an equation for ‘foo’:
        foo = show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)

tcfail133.hs:68:14:
    No instance for (AddDigit (Zero :@ (One :@ One)) One s0)
      arising from a use of ‘add’
    In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely
      ‘add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)’
    In the expression: show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
    In an equation for ‘foo’:
        foo = show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
