    Couldn't match expected type ‘String -> String -> String’
                with actual type ‘a’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for: evalRHS :: Int -> a at tcfail175.hs:10:12
    Relevant bindings include
      evalRHS :: Int -> a (bound at tcfail175.hs:11:1)
    The equation(s) for ‘evalRHS’ have three arguments,
    but its type ‘Int -> a’ has only one
