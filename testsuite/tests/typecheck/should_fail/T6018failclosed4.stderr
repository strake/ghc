    Type family equation violates injectivity annotation.
    Injective type variable ‘n’ does not appear on injective position.
    In the RHS of type family equation:
      KClosed ('S n) m = 'S m
    In the equations for closed type family ‘KClosed’
    In the type family declaration for ‘KClosed’
