    Type family equation violates injectivity annotation.
    Injective type variables ‘a’, ‘b’ do not appear on injective position.
    Injective kind variable ‘k’ is not inferable from the RHS type variables.
    In the RHS of type family equation:
      forall (k :: BOX) (a :: k) (b :: k). Gc a b = Int
    In the equations for closed type family ‘Gc’
    In the type family declaration for ‘Gc’
