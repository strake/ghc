    • Couldn't match expected type ‘a2’ with actual type ‘a1’
        because type variable ‘a2’ would escape its scope
      This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
        an expression type signature:
          a2
        at tcfail198.hs:6:36-41
    • In the expression: x :: a
      In the second argument of ‘(++)’, namely ‘[x :: a]’
      In the expression: xs ++ [x :: a]
    • Relevant bindings include
        xs :: [a1] (bound at tcfail198.hs:6:21)
        x :: a1 (bound at tcfail198.hs:6:19)
