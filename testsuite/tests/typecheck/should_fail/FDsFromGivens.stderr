    Couldn't match type ‘Char’ with ‘[a0]’
    arising from a functional dependency between constraints:
      ‘C Char [a0]’ arising from a use of ‘f’ at FDsFromGivens.hs:21:15
      ‘C Char Char’
        arising from a pattern with constructor
                       KCC :: C Char Char => () -> KCC,
                     in an equation for ‘bar’
        at FDsFromGivens.hs:21:6-10
    In the expression: f
    In an equation for ‘bar’: bar (KCC _) = f
