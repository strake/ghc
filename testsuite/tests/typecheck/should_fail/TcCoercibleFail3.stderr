    Couldn't match representation of type ‘NT2’ with that of ‘NT1’
    arising from trying to show that the representations of
      ‘T NT1’ and
      ‘T NT2’ are the same
    Relevant role signatures:
      type role NT2 representational
      type role NT1 representational
      type role T representational
    In the expression: coerce
    In an equation for ‘foo’: foo = coerce
