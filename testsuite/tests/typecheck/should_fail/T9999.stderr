    No instance for (Typeable F1)
      (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)
      arising from a use of ‘typeRep’
    In the second argument of ‘(==)’, namely
      ‘typeRep (Proxy :: Proxy F1)’
    In the expression:
      typeRep (Proxy :: Proxy F) == typeRep (Proxy :: Proxy F1)
    In an equation for ‘main’:
        main = typeRep (Proxy :: Proxy F) == typeRep (Proxy :: Proxy F1)
