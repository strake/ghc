    Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘Proposition a1’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for transRHS :: [a] -> Int -> Constraint a
          at T1899.hs:9:14
    Expected type: [Proposition a1]
      Actual type: [a]
    Relevant bindings include
      varSet :: [a] (bound at T1899.hs:10:11)
      transRHS :: [a] -> Int -> Constraint a (bound at T1899.hs:10:2)
    In the first argument of ‘Auxiliary’, namely ‘varSet’
    In the first argument of ‘Prop’, namely ‘(Auxiliary varSet)’
