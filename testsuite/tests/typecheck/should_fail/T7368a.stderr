    Couldn't match kind ‘*’ with ‘* -> *’
    When matching types
      f :: * -> *
      Bad :: (* -> *) -> *
    Expected type: f (Bad f)
      Actual type: Bad t0
    Relevant bindings include
      fun :: f (Bad f) -> Bool (bound at T7368a.hs:8:1)
    In the pattern: Bad x
    In an equation for ‘fun’: fun (Bad x) = True
