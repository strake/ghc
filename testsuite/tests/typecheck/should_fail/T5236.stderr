    Couldn't match type ‘A’ with ‘B’
    arising from a functional dependency between:
      constraint ‘Id A B’
        arising from the type signature for loop :: Id A B => Bool
      instance ‘Id A A’ at T5236.hs:10:10-15
    In the ambiguity check for: Id A B => Bool
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‘loop’: loop :: Id A B => Bool
