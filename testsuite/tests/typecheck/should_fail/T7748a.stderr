    Couldn't match expected type ‘a’
                with actual type ‘Maybe (Maybe (r -> ()))’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for test :: a -> r -> () at T7748a.hs:11:9
    Relevant bindings include
      g :: r -> () (bound at T7748a.hs:13:16)
      f :: r -> () (bound at T7748a.hs:13:8)
      zd :: a (bound at T7748a.hs:12:6)
      test :: a -> r -> () (bound at T7748a.hs:12:1)
    In the pattern: Just (Just p)
    In a case alternative: Just (Just p) -> p
    In the expression:
      case zd of {
        Nothing -> const ()
        Just Nothing -> const ()
        Just (Just p) -> p }
