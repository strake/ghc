    • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘(?p::Int) => a0’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        a type expected by the context:
          forall a. a -> String
        at T3102.hs:11:10-12
      Expected type: a -> String
        Actual type: ((?p::Int) => a0) -> String
    • In the first argument of ‘f’, namely ‘t’
      In the expression: f t
      In an equation for ‘result’: result = f t
