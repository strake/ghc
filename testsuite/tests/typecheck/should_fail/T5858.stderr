T5858.hs:11:7: error:
    Ambiguous type variables ‘t0’, ‘t1’ arising from a use of ‘infer’
    prevents the constraint ‘(InferOverloaded
                                ([t0], [t1]))’ from being solved.
    Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘t0’, ‘t1’ should be.
    These potential instance exist:
      instance (t1 ~ String) => InferOverloaded (t1, t1)
        -- Defined at T5858.hs:8:10
    In the expression: infer ([], [])
    In an equation for ‘foo’: foo = infer ([], [])
