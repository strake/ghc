tcfail067.hs:60:12: error:
    • Could not deduce (Ord a)
        arising from a use of ‘numSubRangeNegate’
      from the context: Num a
        bound by the instance declaration at tcfail067.hs:59:10-34
      Possible fix:
        add (Ord a) to the context of the instance declaration
    • In the expression: numSubRangeNegate
      In an equation for ‘negate’: negate = numSubRangeNegate
      In the instance declaration for ‘Num (SubRange a)’
