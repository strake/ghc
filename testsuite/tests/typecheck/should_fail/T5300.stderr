    Could not deduce (C2 a2 b2 c20)
    from the context: (Monad m, C1 a1 b1 c1, C2 a2 b2 c2)
      bound by the type signature for:

    The type variable ‘c20’ is ambiguous
    In the ambiguity check for the type signature for ‘f2’:
      f2 :: forall a1 b2 (m :: * -> *) a2 b1 c1 c2.
            (Monad m, C1 a1 b1 c1, C2 a2 b2 c2) =>
            a1 -> StateT (T b2) m a2
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‘f2’:
      f2 :: (Monad m, C1 a1 b1 c1, C2 a2 b2 c2) =>
            a1 -> StateT (T b2) m a2
