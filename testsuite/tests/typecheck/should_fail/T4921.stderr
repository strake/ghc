    No instance for (C a0 b1) arising from a use of ‘f’
    The type variables ‘a0’, ‘b1’ are ambiguous
    Relevant bindings include x :: a0 (bound at T4921.hs:10:1)
    Note: there is a potential instance available:
      instance C Int Char -- Defined at T4921.hs:7:10
    In the first argument of ‘fst’, namely ‘f’
    In the expression: fst f
    In an equation for ‘x’: x = fst f
