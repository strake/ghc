    Type family equation violates injectivity annotation.
    RHS of injective type family equation is a bare type variable
    but these LHS type and kind patterns are not bare variables: ‘'Z’
      PClosed 'Z m = m
    In the equations for closed type family ‘PClosed’
    In the type family declaration for ‘PClosed’
