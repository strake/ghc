    Overlapping instances for Eq [a] arising from a use of ‘>=’
    Matching instances:
      instance Eq a => Eq [a] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
      instance [overlapping] Eq [T] -- Defined at T5051.hs:8:30
    (The choice depends on the instantiation of ‘a’
     To pick the first instance above, use IncoherentInstances
     when compiling the other instance declarations)
    In the expression: x >= x
    In an equation for ‘foo’: foo x = x >= x
