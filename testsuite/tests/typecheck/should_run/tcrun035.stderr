    Couldn't match type ‘IO a’
                  with ‘forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a’
    Expected type: (forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a) -> IO a
      Actual type: IO a -> IO a
    In the expression: id . id
    In an equation for ‘foo’: foo = id . id
    Relevant bindings include
      foo :: (forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a) -> IO a
