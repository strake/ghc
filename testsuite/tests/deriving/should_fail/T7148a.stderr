    Couldn't match representation of type ‘b’ with that of ‘Result a b’
      ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type forall b1. Proxy b1 -> a -> Result a b1 at T7148a.hs:19:50
    arising from the coercion of the method ‘coerce’
      from type ‘forall b. Proxy b -> a -> Result a b’
        to type ‘forall b.
                 Proxy b -> IS_NO_LONGER a -> Result (IS_NO_LONGER a) b’
    Relevant role signatures:
      type role IS_NO_LONGER representational
      type role Result nominal nominal
      type role Proxy phantom
    When deriving the instance for (Convert (IS_NO_LONGER a))
