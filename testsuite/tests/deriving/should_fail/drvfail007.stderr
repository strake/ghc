drvfail007.hs:4:38:
    No instance for (Eq (Int -> Int))
      (maybe you haven't applied enough arguments to a function?)
      arising from the first field of ‘Foo’ (type ‘Int -> Int’)
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Eq Foo)
