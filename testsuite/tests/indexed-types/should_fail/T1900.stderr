    Couldn't match type ‘Depend s0’ with ‘Depend s’
    NB: ‘Depend’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘s0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: Depend s -> Bool
      Actual type: Depend s0 -> Bool
    In the ambiguity check for: forall s. Bug s => Depend s -> Bool
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‘check’:
      check :: (Bug s) => Depend s -> Bool
