    Overlapping instances for Num (Tower s0 a)
      arising from a use of ‘<+>’
    Matching givens (or their superclasses):
      (Num (Tower s a))
        bound by the instance declaration at T7862.hs:14:10-36
    Matching instances:
      instance Num a => Num (Tower s a) -- Defined at T7862.hs:19:10
    (The choice depends on the instantiation of ‘a, s0’)
    In the expression: (Tower as) <+> (Tower as)
    In a pattern binding: _ = (Tower as) <+> (Tower as)
    In an equation for ‘<+>’:
        (Tower as) <+> _
          = undefined
          where
              _ = (Tower as) <+> (Tower as)
