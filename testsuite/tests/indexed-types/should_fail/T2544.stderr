    Couldn't match type ‘IxMap l’ with ‘IxMap i0’
    NB: ‘IxMap’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘i0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: IxMap (l :|: r) [Int]
      Actual type: BiApp (IxMap i0) (IxMap i1) [Int]
    Relevant bindings include
      empty :: IxMap (l :|: r) [Int] (bound at T2544.hs:15:4)
    In the expression: BiApp empty empty
    In an equation for ‘empty’: empty = BiApp empty empty
