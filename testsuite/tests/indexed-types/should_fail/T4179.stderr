    Couldn't match type ‘A2 (x (A2 (FCon x) -> A3 (FCon x)))’
                  with ‘A2 (FCon x)’
    NB: ‘A2’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    Expected type: x (A2 (FCon x) -> A3 (FCon x))
                   -> A2 (FCon x) -> A3 (FCon x)
      Actual type: x (A2 (FCon x) -> A3 (FCon x))
