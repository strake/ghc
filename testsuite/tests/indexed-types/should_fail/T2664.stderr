      ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the instance declaration at T2664.hs:22:10
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the instance declaration at T2664.hs:22:10
    Expected type: Dual (Dual a)
      Actual type: b
    In the third argument of ‘pchoose’, namely ‘newPChan’
    In the first argument of ‘E’, namely ‘(pchoose Right v newPChan)’
    In the expression:
      E (pchoose Right v newPChan) (pchoose Left v newPChan)
