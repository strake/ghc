    Could not deduce (Dual b ~ Dual a)
    from the context ((a :*: b) ~ Dual c, c ~ Dual (a :*: b))
      bound by the type signature for
                 newPChan :: ((a :*: b) ~ Dual c, c ~ Dual (a :*: b)) =>
                             IO (PChan (a :*: b), PChan c)
      at T2664.hs:23:5-12
    NB: ‘Dual’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    Expected type: PChan c
      Actual type: PChan (Dual b :+: Dual a)
    Relevant bindings include
      v :: MVar (Either (PChan a) (PChan b)) (bound at T2664.hs:24:9)
      newPChan :: IO (PChan (a :*: b), PChan c) (bound at T2664.hs:23:5)
    In the expression:
      E (pchoose Right v newPChan) (pchoose Left v newPChan)
    In the first argument of ‘return’, namely
      ‘(O $ takeMVar v, 
        E (pchoose Right v newPChan) (pchoose Left v newPChan))’
