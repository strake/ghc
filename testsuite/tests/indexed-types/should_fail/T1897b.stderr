    Could not deduce (Depend a0 ~ Depend a)
    from the context (Bug a, Foldable t)
      bound by the inferred type for ‘isValid’:
                 (Bug a, Foldable t) => t (Depend a) -> Bool
      at T1897b.hs:16:1-41
    NB: ‘Depend’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: t (Depend a) -> Bool
      Actual type: t (Depend a0) -> Bool
    When checking that ‘isValid’ has the inferred type
      isValid :: forall a (t :: * -> *).
                 (Bug a, Foldable t) =>
                 t (Depend a) -> Bool
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
