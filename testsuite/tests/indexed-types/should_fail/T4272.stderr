    Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘TermFamily a a’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for laws :: TermLike a => TermFamily a a -> b
          at T4272.hs:14:16
    Expected type: TermFamily a (TermFamily a a)
      Actual type: TermFamily a a
    Relevant bindings include
      t :: TermFamily a a (bound at T4272.hs:15:6)
      laws :: TermFamily a a -> b (bound at T4272.hs:15:1)
    In the first argument of ‘terms’, namely
      ‘(undefined :: TermFamily a a)’
    In the second argument of ‘prune’, namely
      ‘(terms (undefined :: TermFamily a a))’
    In the expression: prune t (terms (undefined :: TermFamily a a))
