    Couldn't match type ‘BasePrimMonad (Rand m)’
                  with ‘t0 (BasePrimMonad (Rand m))’
    The type variable ‘t0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: t0 (BasePrimMonad (Rand m)) a -> Rand m a
      Actual type: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a -> Rand m a
    Relevant bindings include
      liftPrim :: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a -> Rand m a
        (bound at T7729.hs:36:3)
    In the first argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘liftPrim’
    In the expression: liftPrim . lift
