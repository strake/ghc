    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Scalar (V (Scalar (V a)))’
                  with actual type ‘Scalar (V a)’
      NB: ‘Scalar’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    • In the first argument of ‘arcLengthToParam’, namely ‘eps’
      In the expression: arcLengthToParam eps eps
      In an equation for ‘absoluteToParam’:
          absoluteToParam eps seg = arcLengthToParam eps eps
    • Relevant bindings include
        seg :: a (bound at T8227.hs:16:21)
        eps :: Scalar (V a) (bound at T8227.hs:16:17)
        absoluteToParam :: Scalar (V a) -> a -> Scalar (V a)
