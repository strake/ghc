    Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type:
      a ~ Base t (Prim [a] a)
    Expected type: Prim [a] a -> Base t (Prim [a] a)
      Actual type: Prim [a] a -> a
    In the first argument of ‘ana’, namely ‘alg’
    In the expression: ana alg
    Relevant bindings include
      foo :: Prim [a] a -> t (bound at T7354.hs:28:1)
