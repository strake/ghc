    Overlapping instances for EmbedAsChild
                                (IdentityT IO) (XMLGenT m0 (XML m0))
      arising from a use of ‘asChild’
    Matching instances:
      instance [overlapping] (EmbedAsChild m c, m1 ~ m) =>
                             EmbedAsChild m (XMLGenT m1 c)

      instance [overlapping] EmbedAsChild
                               (IdentityT IO) (XMLGenT Identity ())
        -- Defined at T4485.hs:45:30
    (The choice depends on the instantiation of ‘m0’
     To pick the first instance above, use IncoherentInstances
     when compiling the other instance declarations)
    In the expression: asChild
    In the expression: asChild $ (genElement "foo")
    In an equation for ‘asChild’:
        asChild b = asChild $ (genElement "foo")

T4485.hs:50:26:
    No instance for (XMLGen m0) arising from a use of ‘genElement’
    The type variable ‘m0’ is ambiguous
    Note: there is a potential instance available:
      instance XMLGen (IdentityT m) -- Defined at T4485.hs:37:10
    In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘(genElement "foo")’
    In the expression: asChild $ (genElement "foo")
    In an equation for ‘asChild’:
        asChild b = asChild $ (genElement "foo")
