    Couldn't match expected type ‘b0’ with actual type ‘F a’
      because type variable ‘a’ would escape its scope
    This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
      the type signature for: g :: C (F a) => a -> Int
      at T7194.hs:17:23-41
    Relevant bindings include
      y :: a (bound at T7194.hs:18:20)
      g :: a -> Int (bound at T7194.hs:18:18)
      x :: b0 (bound at T7194.hs:17:9)
    In the expression: foo y
    In the first argument of ‘length’, namely ‘[x, foo y]’
