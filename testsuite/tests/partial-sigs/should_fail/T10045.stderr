    Found type wildcard ‘_’ standing for ‘t1 -> Bool -> t2’
    Where: ‘t1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
                the inferred type of copy :: t1 -> Bool -> t2 at T10045.hs:7:10
           ‘t2’ is a rigid type variable bound by
                the inferred type of copy :: t1 -> Bool -> t2 at T10045.hs:7:10
    To use the inferred type, enable PartialTypeSignatures
    Relevant bindings include
      ws1 :: () (bound at T10045.hs:5:11)
      foo :: Meta -> t (bound at T10045.hs:5:1)
    In the type signature for:
      copy :: _
    In the expression:
      let
        copy :: _
        copy w from = copy w True
      in copy ws1 False
    In an equation for ‘foo’:
        foo (Meta ws1)
          = let
              copy :: _
              copy w from = copy w True
            in copy ws1 False
