    • No instance for (Eq (f (f a)))
        arising from a 'deriving' declaration
      Possible fix: fill in the wildcard constraint yourself
    • When deriving the instance for (Eq (Foo f a))

T13324_fail2.hs:11:1: error:
    • Can't make a derived instance of ‘Eq (T a)’:
        Constructor ‘MkT’ is a GADT
        Possible fix: fill in the wildcard constraint yourself
