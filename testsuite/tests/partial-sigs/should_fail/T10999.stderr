T10999.hs:5:12: error:
    Found type wildcard ‘_’ standing for ‘Set.Set a’
    Where: ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
               the inferred type of f :: Ord a => () -> Set.Set a at T10999.hs:6:1
    To use the inferred type, enable PartialTypeSignatures
    In the type signature for:
      f :: () -> _

T10999.hs:6:1: error:
    No instance for (Ord a)
    When checking that ‘f’ has the inferred type
      f :: forall a. () -> Set.Set a
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
