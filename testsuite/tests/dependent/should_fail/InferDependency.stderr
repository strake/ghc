InferDependency.hs:6:13: error:
    • Type constructor argument ‘k’ is used dependently.
      Any dependent arguments must be obviously so, not inferred
      by the type-checker.
      Inferred argument kinds:
        k :: *
        a :: k
      Suggestion: use ‘k’ in a kind to make the dependency clearer.
    • In the data type declaration for ‘Proxy2’
