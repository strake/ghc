    No instance for (Show a1) arising from a use of ‘print’
    Cannot resolve unknown runtime type ‘a1’
    Use :print or :force to determine these types
    Relevant bindings include it :: a1 (bound at <interactive>:11:1)
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance forall (k :: BOX) (s :: k). Show (Proxy s)
        -- Defined in ‘Data.Proxy’
      instance forall (k :: BOX) (a :: k) (b :: k).
               Show (Data.Type.Coercion.Coercion a b)
        -- Defined in ‘Data.Type.Coercion’
      instance forall (k :: BOX) (a :: k) (b :: k). Show (a :~: b)
        -- Defined in ‘Data.Type.Equality’
      ...plus 47 others
    In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it
