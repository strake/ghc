WCompatWarningsOn.hs:11:5: warning:
    Could not deduce (MonadFail m)
      arising from the failable pattern ‘Just _’
      (this will become an error a future GHC release)
    from the context: Monad m
      bound by the type signature for:
                 monadFail :: Monad m => m a
      at WCompatWarningsOn.hs:9:14-27
    Possible fix:
      add (MonadFail m) to the context of
        the type signature for:
          monadFail :: Monad m => m a
    In a stmt of a 'do' block: Just _ <- undefined
    In the expression:
      do { Just _ <- undefined;
           undefined }
    In an equation for ‘monadFail’:
        monadFail
          = do { Just _ <- undefined;
                 undefined }
