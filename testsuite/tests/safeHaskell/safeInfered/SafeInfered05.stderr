SafeInfered05.hs:31:9:
    Unsafe overlapping instances for C [Int] arising from a use of ‘f’
    The matching instance is:
      instance [safe] C [Int] -- Defined at SafeInfered05_A.hs:8:10
    It is compiled in a Safe module and as such can only
    overlap instances from the same module, however it
    overlaps the following instances from different modules:
      instance [overlap ok] C [a] -- Defined at SafeInfered05.hs:27:10
    In the expression: f ([1, 2, 3, 4] :: [Int])
    In an equation for ‘test2’: test2 = f ([1, 2, 3, 4] :: [Int])
