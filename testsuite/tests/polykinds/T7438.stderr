    • Couldn't match expected type ‘t2’ with actual type ‘t3’
        ‘t2’ is untouchable
          inside the constraints: t ~ t1
          bound by a pattern with constructor:

      ‘t2’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of go :: Thrist t1 t -> t3 -> t2 at T7438.hs:6:1
      ‘t3’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of go :: Thrist t1 t -> t3 -> t2 at T7438.hs:6:1
      Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘go’
    • In the expression: acc
      In an equation for ‘go’: go Nil acc = acc
    • Relevant bindings include
        acc :: t3 (bound at T7438.hs:6:8)
        go :: Thrist t1 t -> t3 -> t2 (bound at T7438.hs:6:1)
