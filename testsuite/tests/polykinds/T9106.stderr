    Illegal instance declaration for ‘FunctorN n f a (f fa)’
      The liberal coverage condition fails in class ‘FunctorN’
        for functional dependency: ‘n f a -> fa’
      Reason: lhs types ‘n’, ‘f’, ‘a’
        do not jointly determine rhs type ‘f fa’
    In the instance declaration for ‘FunctorN n f a (f fa)’
