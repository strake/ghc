    • Couldn't match type ‘k2’ with ‘k0’
      ‘k2’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          crtInfo :: forall k2 (m :: k2).
                     Reflects m Int =>
                     TaggedT m Maybe (CRTInfo (GF fp d))
        at T13555.hs:25:14-79
      Expected type: TaggedT m Maybe (CRTInfo (GF fp d))
        Actual type: TaggedT m0 Maybe (CRTInfo (GF fp d))
    • When checking that instance signature for ‘crtInfo’
        is more general than its signature in the class
        Instance sig: forall (m :: k0).
