TH_localname.hs:3:11: error:
    Ambiguous type variable ‘t0’ arising from a use of ‘lift’
    prevents the constraint ‘(Lift t0)’ from being solved.
    Relevant bindings include
      y :: t0 (bound at TH_localname.hs:3:6)
      x :: t0 -> ExpQ (bound at TH_localname.hs:3:1)
    Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘t0’ should be.
    These potential instances exist:
      instance (Lift a, Lift b) => Lift (Either a b)
        -- Defined in ‘Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax’
      instance Lift Int16 -- Defined in ‘Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax’
      instance Lift Int32 -- Defined in ‘Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax’
      ...plus 24 others
      (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
    In the expression: lift y
    In the expression:
      [| y |]
      pending(rn) [<y, lift y>]
    In the expression:
      \ y
        -> [| y |]
           pending(rn) [<y, lift y>]
