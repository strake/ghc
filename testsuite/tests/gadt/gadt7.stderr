    • Couldn't match expected type ‘r’ with actual type ‘r1’
        ‘r’ is untouchable

      ‘r’ is a rigid type variable bound by

      ‘r1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of i1b :: T t -> r1 -> r at gadt7.hs:16:1
      Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘i1b’
    • In the expression: y1

      In the expression: case t1 of { K -> y1 }
