    Couldn't match expected type ‘t’ with actual type ‘r’
      ‘r’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints: t1 ~ Int
        bound by a pattern with constructor: K :: T Int,
                 in a case alternative

      ‘r’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the inferred type of i1b :: T t1 -> r -> t at gadt7.hs:16:1
      ‘t’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the inferred type of i1b :: T t1 -> r -> t at gadt7.hs:16:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘i1b’
    Relevant bindings include
      y1 :: r (bound at gadt7.hs:16:16)
      y :: r (bound at gadt7.hs:16:7)
      i1b :: T t1 -> r -> t (bound at gadt7.hs:16:1)
    In the expression: y1
    In a case alternative: K -> y1
