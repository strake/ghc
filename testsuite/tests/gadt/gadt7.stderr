    Couldn't match expected type ‘t’ with actual type ‘t1’
      ‘t1’ is untouchable

      ‘t1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
           the inferred type of i1b :: T t2 -> t1 -> t at gadt7.hs:16:1
      ‘t’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the inferred type of i1b :: T t2 -> t1 -> t at gadt7.hs:16:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘i1b’
    Relevant bindings include
      y1 :: t1 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:16)
      y :: t1 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:7)
      i1b :: T t2 -> t1 -> t (bound at gadt7.hs:16:1)
    In the expression: y1
    In a case alternative: K -> y1
