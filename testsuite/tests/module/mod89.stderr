mod89.hs:5:1: warning: [-Wdodgy-imports (in -Wextra)]
    The import item ‘map(..)’ suggests that
    ‘map’ has (in-scope) constructors or class methods,
    but it has none

mod89.hs:5:1: warning: [-Wunused-imports (in -Wextra)]
    The import of ‘Prelude’ is redundant
      except perhaps to import instances from ‘Prelude’
    To import instances alone, use: import Prelude()
