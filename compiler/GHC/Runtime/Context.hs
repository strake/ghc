Note [The interactive package]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Type, class, and value declarations at the command prompt are treated
as if they were defined in modules
   interactive:Ghci1
   interactive:Ghci2
   ...etc...
with each bunch of declarations using a new module, all sharing a
common package 'interactive' (see Module.interactiveUnitId, and
GHC.Builtin.Names.mkInteractiveModule).

This scheme deals well with shadowing.  For example:

   ghci> data T = A
   ghci> data T = B
   ghci> :i A
   data Ghci1.T = A  -- Defined at <interactive>:2:10

Here we must display info about constructor A, but its type T has been
shadowed by the second declaration.  But it has a respectable
qualified name (Ghci1.T), and its source location says where it was
defined.

So the main invariant continues to hold, that in any session an
original name M.T only refers to one unique thing.  (In a previous
iteration both the T's above were called :Interactive.T, albeit with
different uniques, which gave rise to all sorts of trouble.)

The details are a bit tricky though:

 * The field ic_mod_index counts which Ghci module we've got up to.
   It is incremented when extending ic_tythings

 * ic_tythings contains only things from the 'interactive' package.

 * Module from the 'interactive' package (Ghci1, Ghci2 etc) never go
   in the Home Package Table (HPT).  When you say :load, that's when we
   extend the HPT.

 * The 'homeUnitId' field of DynFlags is *not* set to 'interactive'.
   It stays as 'main' (or whatever -this-unit-id says), and is the
   package to which :load'ed modules are added to.

 * So how do we arrange that declarations at the command prompt get to
   be in the 'interactive' package?  Simply by setting the tcg_mod
   field of the TcGblEnv to "interactive:Ghci1".  This is done by the
   call to initTc in initTcInteractive, which in turn get the module
   from it 'icInteractiveModule' field of the interactive context.

   The 'homeUnitId' field stays as 'main' (or whatever -this-unit-id says.

 * The main trickiness is that the type environment (tcg_type_env) and
   fixity envt (tcg_fix_env), now contain entities from all the
   interactive-package modules (Ghci1, Ghci2, ...) together, rather
   than just a single module as is usually the case.  So you can't use
   "nameIsLocalOrFrom" to decide whether to look in the TcGblEnv vs
   the HPT/PTE.  This is a change, but not a problem provided you
   know.

* However, the tcg_binds, tcg_sigs, tcg_insts, tcg_fam_insts, etc fields
  of the TcGblEnv, which collect "things defined in this module", all
  refer to stuff define in a single GHCi command, *not* all the commands
  so far.

  In contrast, tcg_inst_env, tcg_fam_inst_env, have instances from
  all GhciN modules, which makes sense -- they are all "home package"
  modules.


Note [Interactively-bound Ids in GHCi]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Ids bound by previous Stmts in GHCi are currently
        a) GlobalIds, with
        b) An External Name, like Ghci4.foo
           See Note [The interactive package] above
        c) A tidied type

 (a) They must be GlobalIds (not LocalIds) otherwise when we come to
     compile an expression using these ids later, the byte code
     generator will consider the occurrences to be free rather than
     global.

 (b) Having an External Name is important because of Note
     [GlobalRdrEnv shadowing] in GHC.Types.Names.RdrName

 (c) Their types are tidied. This is important, because :info may ask
     to look at them, and :info expects the things it looks up to have
     tidy types

Where do interactively-bound Ids come from?

  - GHCi REPL Stmts   e.g.
         ghci> let foo x = x+1
    These start with an Internal Name because a Stmt is a local
    construct, so the renamer naturally builds an Internal name for
    each of its binders.  Then in tcRnStmt they are externalised via
    GHC.Tc.Module.externaliseAndTidyId, so they get Names like Ghic4.foo.

  - Ids bound by the debugger etc have Names constructed by
    GHC.Iface.Env.newInteractiveBinder; at the call sites it is followed by
    mkVanillaGlobal or mkVanillaGlobalWithInfo.  So again, they are
    all Global, External.

  - TyCons, Classes, and Ids bound by other top-level declarations in
    GHCi (eg foreign import, record selectors) also get External
    Names, with Ghci9 (or 8, or 7, etc) as the module name.


Note [ic_tythings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ic_tythings field contains
  * The TyThings declared by the user at the command prompt
    (eg Ids, TyCons, Classes)

  * The user-visible Ids that arise from such things, which
    *don't* come from 'implicitTyThings', notably:
       - record selectors
       - class ops
    The implicitTyThings are readily obtained from the TyThings
    but record selectors etc are not

It does *not* contain
  * DFunIds (they can be gotten from ic_instances)
  * CoAxioms (ditto)

See also Note [Interactively-bound Ids in GHCi]

Note [Override identical instances in GHCi]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you declare a new instance in GHCi that is identical to a previous one,
we simply override the previous one; we don't regard it as overlapping.
e.g.    Prelude> data T = A | B
        Prelude> instance Eq T where ...
        Prelude> instance Eq T where ...   -- This one overrides

It's exactly the same for type-family instances.  See #7102
