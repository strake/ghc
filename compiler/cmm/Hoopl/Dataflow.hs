{-
Note [Unreachable blocks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A block that is not in the domain of tfb_fbase is "currently unreachable".
A currently-unreachable block is not even analyzed.  Reason: consider
constant prop and this graph, with entry point L1:
  L1: x:=3; goto L4
  L2: x:=4; goto L4
  L4: if x>3 goto L2 else goto L5
Here L2 is actually unreachable, but if we process it with bottom input fact,
we'll propagate (x=4) to L4, and nuke the otherwise-good rewriting of L4.

* If a currently-unreachable block is not analyzed, then its rewritten
  graph will not be accumulated in tfb_rg.  And that is good:
  unreachable blocks simply do not appear in the output.

* Note that clients must be careful to provide a fact (even if bottom)
  for each entry point. Otherwise useful blocks may be garbage collected.

* Note that updateFact must set the change-flag if a label goes from
  not-in-fbase to in-fbase, even if its fact is bottom.  In effect the
  real fact lattice is
       UNR
       bottom
       the points above bottom

* Even if the fact is going from UNR to bottom, we still call the
  client's fact_join function because it might give the client
  some useful debugging information.

* All of this only applies for *forward* ixpoints.  For the backward
  case we must treat every block as reachable; it might finish with a
  'return', and therefore have no successors, for example.

-- | Sort the blocks into the right order for analysis. This means reverse
-- postorder for a forward analysis. For the backward one, we simply reverse
-- that (see Note [Backward vs forward analysis]).
--
-- Note: We're using Hoopl's confusingly named `postorder_dfs_from` but AFAICS
-- it returns the *reverse* postorder of the blocks (it visits blocks in the
-- postorder and uses (:) to collect them, which gives the reverse of the
-- visitation order).
sortBlocks

sortBlocks direction entries blockmap =
    case direction of
        Fwd -> fwd
        Bwd -> reverse fwd
  where
    fwd = postorder_dfs_from blockmap entries

-- Note [Backward vs forward analysis]
--
-- The forward and backward cases are not dual.  In the forward case, the entry
-- points are known, and one simply traverses the body blocks from those points.
-- In the backward case, something is known about the exit points, but a
-- backward analysis must also include reachable blocks that don't reach the
-- exit, as in a procedure that loops forever and has side effects.)
-- For instance, let E be the entry and X the exit blocks (arrows indicate
-- control flow)
--   E -> X
--   E -> B
--   B -> C
--   C -> B
-- We do need to include B and C even though they're unreachable in the
-- *reverse* graph (that we could use for backward analysis):
--   E <- X
--   E <- B
--   B <- C
--   C <- B
-- So when sorting the blocks for the backward analysis, we simply take the
-- reverse of what is used for the forward one.

{-
Note [no old fact]

We know that the new_fact is >= _|_, so we don't need to join.  However,
if the new fact is also _|_, and we have already analysed its block,
we don't need to record a change.  So there's a tradeoff here.  It turns
out that always recording a change is faster.
