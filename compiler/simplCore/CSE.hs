                        Simple common sub-expression
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we see
        x1 = C a b
        x2 = C x1 b
we build up a reverse mapping:   C a b  -> x1
                                 C x1 b -> x2
and apply that to the rest of the program.

When we then see
        y1 = C a b
        y2 = C y1 b
we replace the C a b with x1.  But then we *dont* want to
add   x1 -> y1  to the mapping.  Rather, we want the reverse, y1 -> x1
so that a subsequent binding
        y2 = C y1 b
will get transformed to C x1 b, and then to x2.

So we carry an extra var->var substitution which we apply *before* looking up in the
reverse mapping.


Note [Shadowing]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have to be careful about shadowing.
For example, consider
        f = \x -> let y = x+x in
                      h = \x -> x+x
                  in ...

Here we must *not* do CSE on the inner x+x!  The simplifier used to guarantee no
shadowing, but it doesn't any more (it proved too hard), so we clone as we go.
We can simply add clones to the substitution already described.


Note [CSE for bindings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let-bindings have two cases, implemnted by cseRhs.

* Trivial RHS:
     let x = y in ...(h x)....

  Here we want to extend the /substitution/ with x -> y, so that the
  (h x) in the body might CSE with an enclosing (let v = h y in ...).
  NB: the substitution maps InIds, so we extend the substitution with
      a biding for the original InId 'x'

  How can we have a trivial RHS? Doens't the simplifier inline them?

    - First, the original RHS might have been (g z) which has CSE'd
      with an enclosing (let y = g z in ...).  This is super-important.
      See Trac #5996:
         x1 = C a b
         x2 = C x1 b
         y1 = C a b
         y2 = C y1 b
      Here we CSE y1's rhs to 'x1', and then we must add (y1->x1) to
      the substitution so that we can CSE the binding for y2.

    - Second, we use cseRHS for case expression scrutinees too;
      see Note [CSE for case expressions]

* Non-trivial RHS
     let x = h y in ...(h y)...

  Here we want to extend the /reverse mapping (cs_map)/ so that
  we CSE the (h y) call to x.

Notice that
  - the trivial-RHS situation extends the substitution (cs_subst)
  - the non-trivial-RHS situation extends the reverse mapping (cs_map)

Note [CSE for case expressions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
  case scrut_expr of x { ...alts... }
This is very like a strict let-binding
  let !x = scrut_expr in ...
So we use (cseRhs x scrut_expr) to process scrut_expr and x, and as a
result all the stuff under Note [CSE for bindings] applies directly.

For example:

* Trivial scrutinee
     f = \x -> case x of wild {
                 (a:as) -> case a of wild1 {
                             (p,q) -> ...(wild1:as)...

  Here, (wild1:as) is morally the same as (a:as) and hence equal to
  wild. But that's not quite obvious.  In the rest of the compiler we
  want to keep it as (wild1:as), but for CSE purpose that's a bad
  idea.

  By using cseRhs we add the binding (wild1 -> a) to the substitution,
  which does exactly the right thing.

  (Notice this is exactly backwards to what the simplifier does, which
  is to try to replaces uses of 'a' with uses of 'wild1'.)

  This is the main reason that cseRHs is called with a trivial rhs.

* Non-trivial scrutinee
     case (f x) of y { pat -> ...let y = f x in ... }

  By using cseRhs we'll add (f x :-> y) to the cs_map, and
  thereby CSE the inner (f x) to y.

Note [CSE for INLINE and NOINLINE]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are some subtle interactions of CSE with functions that the user
has marked as INLINE or NOINLINE. (Examples from Roman Leshchinskiy.)
Consider

        yes :: Int  {-# NOINLINE yes #-}
        yes = undefined

        no :: Int   {-# NOINLINE no #-}
        no = undefined

        foo :: Int -> Int -> Int  {-# NOINLINE foo #-}
        foo m n = n

        {-# RULES "foo/no" foo no = id #-}

        bar :: Int -> Int
        bar = foo yes

We do not expect the rule to fire.  But if we do CSE, then we risk
getting yes=no, and the rule does fire.  Actually, it won't because
NOINLINE means that 'yes' will never be inlined, not even if we have
yes=no.  So that's fine (now; perhaps in the olden days, yes=no would
have substituted even if 'yes' was NOINLINE).

But we do need to take care.  Consider

        {-# NOINLINE bar #-}
        bar = <rhs>     -- Same rhs as foo

        foo = <rhs>

If CSE produces
        foo = bar
then foo will never be inlined to <rhs> (when it should be, if <rhs>
is small).  The conclusion here is this:

   We should not add
       <rhs> :-> bar
  to the CSEnv if 'bar' has any constraints on when it can inline;
  that is, if its 'activation' not always active.  Otherwise we
  might replace <rhs> by 'bar', and then later be unable to see that it
  really was <rhs>.

Note that we do not (currently) do CSE on the unfolding stored inside
an Id, even if is a 'stable' unfolding.  That means that when an
unfolding happens, it is always faithful to what the stable unfolding
originally was.

Note [CSE for stable unfoldings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   {-# Unf = Stable (\pq. build blah) #-}
   foo = x

Here 'foo' has a stable unfolding, but its (optimised) RHS is trivial.
(Turns out that this actually happens for the enumFromTo method of
the Integer instance of Enum in GHC.Enum.)  Then we obviously do NOT
want to extend the substitution with (foo->x)!   See similar
SimplUtils Note [Stable unfoldings and postInlineUnconditionally].

Nor do we want to change the reverse mapping. Suppose we have

   {-# Unf = Stable (\pq. build blah) #-}
   foo = <expr>
   bar = <expr>

There could conceivably be merit in rewriting the RHS of bar:
   bar = foo
but now bar's inlining behaviour will change, and importing
modules might see that.  So it seems dodgy and we don't do it.

Note [Corner case for case expressions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consdider
   case x |> co of (y::Array# Int) { ... }

Is it ok to extend the substutition with (y -> x |> co)?
Because y is of unlifted type, this is only OK if (x |> co) is
ok-for-speculation, else we'll destroy the let/app invariant.
But surely it is ok-for-speculation, becasue it's a trivial
expression, and x's type is also unlifted, presumably.

Well, maybe not if you are using unsafe casts.  I actually found
a case where we had
   (x :: HValue) |> (UnsafeCo :: HValue ~ Array# Int)
This is a vanishingly strange corner case, but we still have
to check.

We do the check in cseRhs, but it can't fire when cseRhs is called
from a let-binding, because they are always ok-for-speculation.  Never
mind!
