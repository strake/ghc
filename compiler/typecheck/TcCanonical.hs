Note [Canonicalization]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Canonicalization converts a simple constraint to a canonical form. It is
unary (i.e. treats individual constraints one at a time), does not do
any zonking, but lives in TcS monad because it needs to create fresh
variables (for flattening) and consult the inerts (for efficiency).

The execution plan for canonicalization is the following:

  1) Decomposition of equalities happens as necessary until we reach a
     variable or type family in one side. There is no decomposition step
     for other forms of constraints.

  2) If, when we decompose, we discover a variable on the head then we
     look at inert_eqs from the current inert for a substitution for this
     variable and contine decomposing. Hence we lazily apply the inert
     substitution if it is needed.

  3) If no more decomposition is possible, we deeply apply the substitution
     from the inert_eqs and continue with flattening.

  4) During flattening, we examine whether we have already flattened some
     function application by looking at all the CTyFunEqs with the same
     function in the inert set. The reason for deeply applying the inert
     substitution at step (3) is to maximise our chances of matching an
     already flattened family application in the inert.

The net result is that a constraint coming out of the canonicalization
phase cannot be rewritten any further from the inerts (but maybe /it/ can
rewrite an inert or still interact with an inert in a further phase in the
simplifier.

Note [Caching for canonicals]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our plan with pre-canonicalization is to be able to solve a constraint
really fast from existing bindings in TcEvBinds. So one may think that
the condition (isCNonCanonical) is not necessary.  However consider
the following setup:

InertSet = { [W] d1 : Num t }
WorkList = { [W] d2 : Num t, [W] c : t ~ Int}

Now, we prioritize equalities, but in our concrete example
(should_run/mc17.hs) the first (d2) constraint is dealt with first,
because (t ~ Int) is an equality that only later appears in the
worklist since it is pulled out from a nested implication
constraint. So, let's examine what happens:

   - We encounter work item (d2 : Num t)

   - Nothing is yet in EvBinds, so we reach the interaction with inerts
     and set:
              d2 := d1
    and we discard d2 from the worklist. The inert set remains unaffected.

   - Now the equation ([W] c : t ~ Int) is encountered and kicks-out
     (d1 : Num t) from the inerts.  Then that equation gets
     spontaneously solved, perhaps. We end up with:
        InertSet : { [G] c : t ~ Int }
        WorkList : { [W] d1 : Num t}

   - Now we examine (d1), we observe that there is a binding for (Num
     t) in the evidence binds and we set:
             d1 := d2
     and end up in a loop!

Now, the constraints that get kicked out from the inert set are always
Canonical, so by restricting the use of the pre-canonicalizer to
NonCanonical constraints we eliminate this danger. Moreover, for
canonical constraints we already have good caching mechanisms
(effectively the interaction solver) and we are interested in reducing
things like superclasses of the same non-canonical constraint being
generated hence I don't expect us to lose a lot by introducing the
(isCNonCanonical) restriction.

A similar situation can arise in TcSimplify, at the end of the
solve_wanteds function, where constraints from the inert set are
returned as new work -- our substCt ensures however that if they are
not rewritten by subst, they remain canonical and hence we will not
attempt to solve them from the EvBinds. If on the other hand they did
get rewritten and are now non-canonical they will still not match the
EvBinds, so we are again good.

{- Note [Adding superclasses]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since dictionaries are canonicalized only once in their lifetime, the
place to add their superclasses is canonicalisation.  See Note [Add
superclasses only during canonicalisation].  Here is what we do:

  Givens:   Add all their superclasses as Givens.
            They may be needed to prove Wanteds

  Wanteds:  Do nothing.

  Deriveds: Add all their superclasses as Derived.
            The sole reason is to expose functional dependencies
            in superclasses or equality superclasses.

            We only do this in the improvement phase, if solving has
            not succeeded; see Note [The improvement story] in
            TcInteract

Examples of how adding superclasses as Derived is useful

    --- Example 1
        class C a b | a -> b
    Suppose we want to solve
         [G] C a b
         [W] C a beta
    Then adding [D] beta~b will let us solve it.

    -- Example 2 (similar but using a type-equality superclass)
        class (F a ~ b) => C a b
    And try to sllve:
         [G] C a b
         [W] C a beta
    Follow the superclass rules to add
         [G] F a ~ b
         [D] F a ~ beta
    Now we we get [D] beta ~ b, and can solve that.

---------- Historical note -----------
Example of why adding superclass of a Wanted as a Given would
be terrible, see Note [Do not add superclasses of solved dictionaries]
in TcSMonad, which has this example:
        class Ord a => C a where
        instance Ord [a] => C [a] where ...
Suppose we are trying to solve
  [G] d1 : Ord a
  [W] d2 : C [a]
If we (bogusly) added the superclass of d2 as Gievn we'd have
  [G] d1 : Ord a
  [W] d2 : C [a]
  [G] d3 : Ord [a]   -- Superclass of d2, bogus

Then we'll use the instance decl to give
  [G] d1 : Ord a     Solved: d2 : C [a] = $dfCList d4
  [G] d3 : Ord [a]   -- Superclass of d2, bogus
  [W] d4: Ord [a]

ANd now we could bogusly solve d4 from d3.


Note [Add superclasses only during canonicalisation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We add superclasses only during canonicalisation, on the passage
from CNonCanonical to CDictCan.  A class constraint can be repeatedly
rewritten, and there's no point in repeatedly adding its superclasses.

Here's a serious, but now out-dated example, from Trac #4497:

   class Num (RealOf t) => Normed t
   type family RealOf x

Assume the generated wanted constraint is:
   [W] RealOf e ~ e
   [W] Normed e

If we were to be adding the superclasses during simplification we'd get:
   [W] RealOf e ~ e
   [W] Normed e
   [D] RealOf e ~ fuv
   [D] Num fuv
==>
   e := fuv, Num fuv, Normed fuv, RealOf fuv ~ fuv

While looks exactly like our original constraint. If we add the
superclass of (Normed fuv) again we'd loop.  By adding superclasses
definitely only once, during canonicalisation, this situation can't
happen.

Mind you, now that Wanteds cannot rewrite Derived, I think this particular
situation can't happen.

Note [Canonicalising equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to canonicalise an equality, we look at the structure of the
two types at hand, looking for similarities. A difficulty is that the
types may look dissimilar before flattening but similar after flattening.
However, we don't just want to jump in and flatten right away, because
this might be wasted effort. So, after looking for similarities and failing,
we flatten and then try again. Of course, we don't want to loop, so we
track whether or not we've already flattened.

It is conceivable to do a better job at tracking whether or not a type
is flattened, but this is left as future work. (Mar '15)

Note [Newtypes can blow the stack]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have

  newtype X = MkX (Int -> X)
  newtype Y = MkY (Int -> Y)

and now wish to prove

  [W] X ~R Y

This Wanted will loop, expanding out the newtypes ever deeper looking
for a solid match or a solid discrepancy. Indeed, there is something
appropriate to this looping, because X and Y *do* have the same representation,
in the limit -- they're both (Fix ((->) Int)). However, no finitely-sized
coercion will ever witness it. This loop won't actually cause GHC to hang,
though, because we check our depth when unwrapping newtypes.

Note [Eager reflexivity check]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have

  newtype X = MkX (Int -> X)

and

  [W] X ~R X

Naively, we would start unwrapping X and end up in a loop. Instead,
we do this eager reflexivity check. This is necessary only for representational
equality because the flattener technology deals with the similar case
(recursive type families) for nominal equality.

Note that this check does not catch all cases, but it will catch the cases
we're most worried about, types like X above that are actually inhabited.

Here's another place where this reflexivity check is key:
Consider trying to prove (f a) ~R (f a). The AppTys in there can't
be decomposed, because representational equality isn't congruent with respect
to AppTy. So, when canonicalising the equality above, we get stuck and
would normally produce a CIrredEvCan. However, we really do want to
be able to solve (f a) ~R (f a). So, in the representational case only,
we do a reflexivity check.

(This would be sound in the nominal case, but unnecessary, and I [Richard
E.] am worried that it would slow down the common case.)

Note [Use canEqFailure in canDecomposableTyConApp]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We must use canEqFailure, not canEqHardFailure here, because there is
the possibility of success if working with a representational equality.
Here is one case:

  type family TF a where TF Char = Bool
  data family DF a
  newtype instance DF Bool = MkDF Int

Suppose we are canonicalising (Int ~R DF (TF a)), where we don't yet
know `a`. This is *not* a hard failure, because we might soon learn
that `a` is, in fact, Char, and then the equality succeeds.

Here is another case:

  [G] Age ~R Int

where Age's constructor is not in scope. We don't want to report
an "inaccessible code" error in the context of this Given!

For example, see typecheck/should_compile/T10493, repeated here:

  import Data.Ord (Down)  -- no constructor

  foo :: Coercible (Down Int) Int => Down Int -> Int
  foo = coerce

That should compile, but only because we use canEqFailure and not
canEqHardFailure.

Note [Decomposing equality]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we have a constraint (of any flavour and role) that looks like
T tys1 ~ T tys2, what can we conclude about tys1 and tys2? The answer,
of course, is "it depends". This Note spells it all out.

In this Note, "decomposition" refers to taking the constraint
  [fl] (T tys1 ~X T tys2)
(for some flavour fl and some role X) and replacing it with
  [fls'] (tys1 ~Xs' tys2)
where that notation indicates a list of new constraints, where the
new constraints may have different flavours and different roles.

The key property to consider is injectivity. When decomposing a Given the
decomposition is sound if and only if T is injective in all of its type
arguments. When decomposing a Wanted, the decomposition is sound (assuming the
correct roles in the produced equality constraints), but it may be a guess --
that is, an unforced decision by the constraint solver. Decomposing Wanteds
over injective TyCons does not entail guessing. But sometimes we want to
decompose a Wanted even when the TyCon involved is not injective! (See below.)

So, in broad strokes, we want this rule:

(*) Decompose a constraint (T tys1 ~X T tys2) if and only if T is injective
at role X.

Pursuing the details requires exploring three axes:
* Flavour: Given vs. Derived vs. Wanted
* Role: Nominal vs. Representational
* TyCon species: datatype vs. newtype vs. data family vs. type family vs. type variable

(So a type variable isn't a TyCon, but it's convenient to put the AppTy case
in the same table.)

Right away, we can say that Derived behaves just as Wanted for the purposes
of decomposition. The difference between Derived and Wanted is the handling of
evidence. Since decomposition in these cases isn't a matter of soundness but of
guessing, we want the same behavior regardless of evidence.

Here is a table (discussion following) detailing where decomposition of
   (T s1 ... sn) ~r (T t1 .. tn)
is allowed.  The first four lines (Data types ... type family) refer
to TyConApps with various TyCons T; the last line is for AppTy, where
there is presumably a type variable at the head, so it's actually
   (s s1 ... sn) ~r (t t1 .. tn)

Type variable          NO{4}                       NO{4}

{1}: Type families can be injective in some, but not all, of their arguments,
so we want to do partial decomposition. This is quite different than the way
other decomposition is done, where the decomposed equalities replace the original
one. We thus proceed much like we do with superclasses: emitting new Givens
when "decomposing" a partially-injective type family Given and new Deriveds
when "decomposing" a partially-injective type family Wanted. (As of the time of
writing, 13 June 2015, the implementation of injective type families has not
been merged, but it should be soon. Please delete this parenthetical if the
implementation is indeed merged.)

{2}: See Note [Decomposing newtypes at representational role]

{3}: Because of the possibility of newtype instances, we must treat
data families like newtypes. See also Note [Decomposing newtypes at
representational role]. See #10534 and test case
typecheck/should_fail/T10534.

{4}: Because type variables can stand in for newtypes, we conservatively do not
decompose AppTys over representational equality.

In the implementation of can_eq_nc and friends, we don't directly pattern
match using lines like in the tables above, as those tables don't cover
all cases (what about PrimTyCon? tuples?). Instead we just ask about injectivity,
boiling the tables above down to rule (*). The exceptions to rule (*) are for
injective type families, which are handled separately from other decompositions,
and the MAYBE entries above.

Note [Decomposing newtypes at representational role]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This note discusses the 'newtype' line in the REPRESENTATIONAL table
in Note [Decomposing equality]. (At nominal role, newtypes are fully
decomposable.)

Here is a representative example of why representational equality over
newtypes is tricky:

  newtype Nt a = Mk Bool         -- NB: a is not used in the RHS,
  type role Nt representational  -- but the user gives it an R role anyway

If we have [W] Nt alpha ~R Nt beta, we *don't* want to decompose to
[W] alpha ~R beta, because it's possible that alpha and beta aren't
representationally equal. Here's another example.

  newtype Nt a = MkNt (Id a)
  type family Id a where Id a = a

  [W] Nt Int ~R Nt Age

Because of its use of a type family, Nt's parameter will get inferred to have
a nominal role. Thus, decomposing the wanted will yield [W] Int ~N Age, which
is unsatisfiable. Unwrapping, though, leads to a solution.

Conclusion:
 * Unwrap newtypes before attempting to decompose them.
   This is done in can_eq_nc'.

It all comes from the fact that newtypes aren't necessarily injective
w.r.t. representational equality.

Furthermore, as explained in Note [NthCo and newtypes] in Coercion, we can't use
NthCo on representational coercions over newtypes. NthCo comes into play
only when decomposing givens.

Conclusion:
 * Do not decompose [G] N s ~R N t

Is it sensible to decompose *Wanted* constraints over newtypes?  Yes!
It's the only way we could ever prove (IO Int ~R IO Age), recalling
that IO is a newtype.

However we must be careful.  Consider

  type role Nt representational

  [G] Nt a ~R Nt b       (1)
  [W] NT alpha ~R Nt b   (2)
  [W] alpha ~ a          (3)

If we focus on (3) first, we'll substitute in (2), and now it's
identical to the given (1), so we succeed.  But if we focus on (2)
first, and decompose it, we'll get (alpha ~R b), which is not soluble.
This is exactly like the question of overlapping Givens for class
constraints: see Note [Instance and Given overlap] in TcInteract.

Conclusion:
  * Decompose [W] N s ~R N t  iff there no given constraint that could
    later solve it.

Note [Decomposing TyConApps]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we see (T s1 t1 ~ T s2 t2), then we can just decompose to
  (s1 ~ s2, t1 ~ t2)
and push those back into the work list.  But if
  s1 = K k1    s2 = K k2
then we will jus decomopose s1~s2, and it might be better to
do so on the spot.  An important special case is where s1=s2,
and we get just Refl.

So canDecomposableTyCon is a fast-path decomposition that uses
unifyWanted etc to short-cut that work.

Note [Canonicalising type applications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Given (s1 t1) ~ ty2, how should we proceed?
The simple things is to see if ty2 is of form (s2 t2), and
decompose.  By this time s1 and s2 can't be saturated type
function applications, because those have been dealt with
by an earlier equation in can_eq_nc, so it is always sound to
decompose.

However, over-eager decomposition gives bad error messages
for things like
   a b ~ Maybe c
   e f ~ p -> q
Suppose (in the first example) we already know a~Array.  Then if we
decompose the application eagerly, yielding
   a ~ Maybe
   b ~ c
we get an error        "Can't match Array ~ Maybe",
but we'd prefer to get "Can't match Array b ~ Maybe c".

So instead can_eq_wanted_app flattens the LHS and RHS, in the hope of
replacing (a b) by (Array b), before using try_decompose_app to
decompose it.

Note [Make sure that insolubles are fully rewritten]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When an equality fails, we still want to rewrite the equality
all the way down, so that it accurately reflects
 (a) the mutable reference substitution in force at start of solving
 (b) any ty-binds in force at this point in solving
See Note [Kick out insolubles] in TcSMonad.
And if we don't do this there is a bad danger that
TcSimplify.applyTyVarDefaulting will find a variable
that has in fact been substituted.

Note [Do not decompose Given polytype equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider [G] (forall a. t1 ~ forall a. t2).  Can we decompose this?
No -- what would the evidence look like?  So instead we simply discard
this given evidence.


Note [Combining insoluble constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As this point we have an insoluble constraint, like Int~Bool.

 * If it is Wanted, delete it from the cache, so that subsequent
   Int~Bool constraints give rise to separate error messages

 * But if it is Derived, DO NOT delete from cache.  A class constraint
   may get kicked out of the inert set, and then have its functional
   dependency Derived constraints generated a second time. In that
   case we don't want to get two (or more) error messages by
   generating two (or more) insoluble fundep constraints from the same
   class constraint.

Note [No top-level newtypes on RHS of representational equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we're in this situation:

 work item:  [W] c1 : a ~R b
     inert:  [G] c2 : b ~R Id a

where
  newtype Id a = Id a

We want to make sure canEqTyVar sees [W] a ~R a, after b is flattened
and the Id newtype is unwrapped. This is assured by requiring only flat
types in canEqTyVar *and* having the newtype-unwrapping check above
the tyvar check in can_eq_nc.

Note [Canonical orientation for tyvar/tyvar equality constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we have a ~ b where both 'a' and 'b' are TcTyVars, which way
round should be oriented in the CTyEqCan?  The rules, implemented by
canEqTyVarTyVar, are these

 * If either is a flatten-meta-variables, it goes on the left.

 * If one is a strict sub-kind of the other e.g.
       (alpha::?) ~ (beta::*)
   orient them so RHS is a subkind of LHS.  That way we will replace
   'a' with 'b', correctly narrowing the kind.
   This establishes the subkind invariant of CTyEqCan.

 * Put a meta-tyvar on the left if possible
       alpha[3] ~ r

 * If both are meta-tyvars, put the more touchable one (deepest level
   number) on the left, so there is the best chance of unifying it
        alpha[3] ~ beta[2]

 * If both are meta-tyvars and both at the same level, put a SigTv
   on the right if possible
        alpha[2] ~ beta[2](sig-tv)
   That way, when we unify alpha := beta, we don't lose the SigTv flag.

 * Put a meta-tv with a System Name on the left if possible so it
   gets eliminated (improves error messages)

 * If one is a flatten-skolem, put it on the left so that it is
   substituted out  Note [Elminate flat-skols]
        fsk ~ a

Note [Avoid unnecessary swaps]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we swap without actually improving matters, we can get an infnite loop.
Consider
    work item:  a ~ b
   inert item:  b ~ c
We canonicalise the work-time to (a ~ c).  If we then swap it before
aeding to the inert set, we'll add (c ~ a), and therefore kick out the
inert guy, so we get
   new work item:  b ~ c
   inert item:     c ~ a
And now the cycle just repeats

Note [Eliminate flat-skols]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have  [G] Num (F [a])
then we flatten to
     [G] Num fsk
     [G] F [a] ~ fsk
where fsk is a flatten-skolem (FlatSkol). Suppose we have
      type instance F [a] = a
then we'll reduce the second constraint to
     [G] a ~ fsk
and then replace all uses of 'a' with fsk.  That's bad because
in error messages intead of saying 'a' we'll say (F [a]).  In all
places, including those where the programmer wrote 'a' in the first
place.  Very confusing!  See Trac #7862.

Solution: re-orient a~fsk to fsk~a, so that we preferentially eliminate
the fsk.

Note [Equalities with incompatible kinds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
canEqLeaf is about to make a CTyEqCan or CFunEqCan; but both have the
invariant that LHS and RHS satisfy the kind invariants for CTyEqCan,
CFunEqCan.  What if we try to unify two things with incompatible
kinds?

eg    a ~ b  where a::*, b::*->*
or    a ~ b  where a::*, b::k, k is a kind variable

The CTyEqCan compatKind invariant is important.  If we make a CTyEqCan
for a~b, then we might well *substitute* 'b' for 'a', and that might make
a well-kinded type ill-kinded; and that is bad (eg typeKind can crash, see
Trac #7696).

So instead for these ill-kinded equalities we generate a CIrredCan,
and put it in the inert set, which keeps it out of the way until a
subsequent substitution (on kind variables, say) re-activates it.

NB: it is important that the types s1,s2 are flattened and zonked
    so that their kinds k1, k2 are inert wrt the substitution.  That
    means that they can only become the same if we change the inert
    set, which in turn will kick out the irreducible equality
    E.g. it is WRONG to make an irred (a:k1)~(b:k2)
         if we already have a substitution k1:=k2

NB: it's important that the new CIrredCan goes in the inert set rather
than back into the work list. We used to do the latter, but that led
to an infinite loop when we encountered it again, and put it back in
the work list again.

See also Note [Kind orientation for CTyEqCan] and
         Note [Kind orientation for CFunEqCan] in TcRnTypes

Note [Type synonyms and canonicalization]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We treat type synonym applications as xi types, that is, they do not
count as type function applications.  However, we do need to be a bit
careful with type synonyms: like type functions they may not be
generative or injective.  However, unlike type functions, they are
parametric, so there is no problem in expanding them whenever we see
them, since we do not need to know anything about their arguments in
order to expand them; this is what justifies not having to treat them
as specially as type function applications.  The thing that causes
some subtleties is that we prefer to leave type synonym applications
*unexpanded* whenever possible, in order to generate better error
messages.

If we encounter an equality constraint with type synonym applications
on both sides, or a type synonym application on one side and some sort
of type application on the other, we simply must expand out the type
synonyms in order to continue decomposing the equality constraint into
primitive equality constraints.  For example, suppose we have

  type F a = [Int]

and we encounter the equality

  F a ~ [b]

In order to continue we must expand F a into [Int], giving us the
equality

  [Int] ~ [b]

which we can then decompose into the more primitive equality
constraint

  Int ~ b.

However, if we encounter an equality constraint with a type synonym
application on one side and a variable on the other side, we should
NOT (necessarily) expand the type synonym, since for the purpose of
good error messages we want to leave type synonyms unexpanded as much
as possible.  Hence the ps_ty1, ps_ty2 argument passed to canEqTyVar.

The flattener preserves type synonyms, so they should appear in new_pred

{- Note [unifyWanted and unifyDerived]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When decomposing equalities we often create new wanted constraints for
(s ~ t).  But what if s=t?  Then it'd be faster to return Refl right away.
Similar remarks apply for Derived.

Rather than making an equality test (which traverses the structure of the
type, perhaps fruitlessly, unifyWanted traverses the common structure, and
bales out when it finds a difference by creating a new Wanted constraint.
But where it succeeds in finding common structure, it just builds a coercion
to reflect it.
