Various types used during typechecking, please see TcRnMonad as well for
operations on these types. You probably want to import it, instead of this
module.

All the monads exported here are built on top of the same IOEnv monad. The
monad functions like a Reader monad in the way it passes the environment
around. This is done to allow the environment to be manipulated in a stack
like fashion when entering expressions... ect.

For state that is global and should be returned at the end (e.g not part
of the stack mechanism), you should use an TcRef (= IORef) to store them.

-- Note [Signature parameters in TcGblEnv and DynFlags]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- When compiling signature files, we need to know which implementation
-- we've actually linked against the signature.  There are three seemingly
-- redundant places where this information is stored: in DynFlags, there
-- is sigOf, and in TcGblEnv, there is tcg_sig_of and tcg_impl_rdr_env.
-- Here's the difference between each of them:
--
-- * DynFlags.sigOf is global per invocation of GHC.  If we are compiling
--   with --make, there may be multiple signature files being compiled; in
--   which case this parameter is a map from local module name to implementing
--   Module.
--
-- * HscEnv.tcg_sig_of is global per the compilation of a single file, so
--   it is simply the result of looking up tcg_mod in the DynFlags.sigOf
--   parameter.  It's setup in TcRnMonad.initTc.  This prevents us
--   from having to repeatedly do a lookup in DynFlags.sigOf.
--
-- * HscEnv.tcg_impl_rdr_env is a RdrEnv that lets us look up names
--   according to the sig-of module.  It's setup in TcRnDriver.tcRnSignature.
--   Here is an example showing why we need this map:
--
--  module A where
--      a = True
--
--  module ASig where
--      import B
--      a :: Bool
--
--  module B where
--      b = False
--
-- When we compile ASig --sig-of main:A, the default
-- global RdrEnv (tcg_rdr_env) has an entry for b, but not for a
-- (we never imported A).  So we have to look in a different environment
-- to actually get the original name.
--
-- By the way, why do we need to do the lookup; can't we just use A:a
-- as the name directly?  Well, if A is reexporting the entity from another
-- module, then the original name needs to be the real original name:
--
--  module C where
--      a = True
--
--  module A(a) where
--      import C

Note [Tracking unused binding and imports]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We gather three sorts of usage information
 * tcg_dus (defs/uses)
      Records *defined* Names (local, top-level)
          and *used*    Names (local or imported)

      Used (a) to report "defined but not used"
               (see RnNames.reportUnusedNames)
           (b) to generate version-tracking usage info in interface
               files (see MkIface.mkUsedNames)
   This usage info is mainly gathered by the renamer's
   gathering of free-variables

 * tcg_used_rdrnames
      Records used *imported* (not locally-defined) RdrNames
      Used only to report unused import declarations
      Notice that they are RdrNames, not Names, so we can
      tell whether the reference was qualified or unqualified, which
      is esssential in deciding whether a particular import decl
      is unnecessary.  This info isn't present in Names.

 * tcg_used_selectors
      Records the record selectors that are used
      by the DuplicateRecordFields extension.  These
      may otherwise be missed from tcg_used_rdrnames as a
      single RdrName might refer to multiple fields.

Note [The Global-Env/Local-Env story]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During type checking, we keep in the tcg_type_env
        * All types and classes
        * All Ids derived from types and classes (constructors, selectors)

At the end of type checking, we zonk the local bindings,
and as we do so we add to the tcg_type_env
        * Locally defined top-level Ids

Why?  Because they are now Ids not TcIds.  This final GlobalEnv is
        a) fed back (via the knot) to typechecking the
           unfoldings of interface signatures
        b) used in the ModDetails of this module

Because of GADTs, we have to pass inwards the Insts provided by type signatures

        f :: Eq a => T a -> Bool
        f (T1 x y) = [x]==[y]

The constructor T1 binds an existential variable 'b', and we need Eq [b].
Well, we have it, because Eq a refines to Eq [b], but we can only spot that if we
pass it inwards.

-- Arrow-notation context
---------------------------

{- Note [Escaping the arrow scope]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In arrow notation, a variable bound by a proc (or enclosed let/kappa)
is not in scope to the left of an arrow tail (-<) or the head of (|..|).
For example

        proc x -> (e1 -< e2)

Here, x is not in scope in e1, but it is in scope in e2.  This can get
a bit complicated:

        let x = 3 in
        proc y -> (proc z -> e1) -< e2

Here, x and z are in scope in e1, but y is not.

We implement this by
recording the environment when passing a proc (using newArrowScope),
and returning to that (using escapeArrowScope) on the left of -< and the
head of (|..|).

All this can be dealt with by the *renamer*. But the type checker needs
to be involved too.  Example (arrowfail001)
  class Foo a where foo :: a -> ()
  data Bar = forall a. Foo a => Bar a
  get :: Bar -> ()
  get = proc x -> case x of Bar a -> foo -< a
Here the call of 'foo' gives rise to a (Foo a) constraint that should not
be captured by the pattern match on 'Bar'.  Rather it should join the
constraints from further out.  So we must capture the constraint bag
from further out in the ArrowCtxt that we push inwards.

{- Note [Bindings with closed types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider

  f x = let g ys = map not ys
        in ...

Can we generalise 'g' under the OutsideIn algorithm?  Yes,
because all g's free variables are top-level; that is they themselves
have no free type variables, and it is the type variables in the
environment that makes things tricky for OutsideIn generalisation.

Definition:
   A variable is "closed", and has tct_closed set to TopLevel,
iff
   a) all its free variables are imported, or are let-bound with closed types
   b) generalisation is not restricted by the monomorphism restriction

Invariant: a closed variable has no free type variables in its type.

Under OutsideIn we are free to generalise a closed let-binding.
This is an extension compared to the JFP paper on OutsideIn, which
used "top-level" as a proxy for "closed".  (It's not a good proxy
anyway -- the MR can make a top-level binding with a free type
variable.)

Note that:
  * A top-level binding may not be closed, if it suffers from the MR

  * A nested binding may be closed (eg 'g' in the example we started with)
    Indeed, that's the point; whether a function is defined at top level
    or nested is orthogonal to the question of whether or not it is closed

  * A binding may be non-closed because it mentions a lexically scoped
    *type variable*  Eg
        f :: forall a. blah
        f x = let g y = ...(y::a)...

Note [Hole constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CHoleCan constraints are used for two kinds of holes,
distinguished by cc_hole:

  * For holes in expressions
    e.g.   f x = g _ x

  * For holes in type signatures
    e.g.   f :: _ -> _
           f x = [x,True]

Note [Kind orientation for CTyEqCan]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Given an equality (t:* ~ s:Open), we can't solve it by updating t:=s,
ragardless of how touchable 't' is, because the kinds don't work.

Instead we absolutely must re-orient it. Reason: if that gets into the
inert set we'll start replacing t's by s's, and that might make a
kind-correct type into a kind error.  After re-orienting,
we may be able to solve by updating s:=t.

Hence in a CTyEqCan, (t:k1 ~ xi:k2) we require that k2 is a subkind of k1.

If the two have incompatible kinds, we just don't use a CTyEqCan at all.
See Note [Equalities with incompatible kinds] in TcCanonical

We can't require *equal* kinds, because
     * wanted constraints don't necessarily have identical kinds
               eg   alpha::? ~ Int
     * a solved wanted constraint becomes a given

Note [Kind orientation for CFunEqCan]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For (F xis ~ rhs) we require that kind(lhs) is a subkind of kind(rhs).
This really only maters when rhs is an Open type variable (since only type
variables have Open kinds):
   F ty ~ (a:Open)
which can happen, say, from
      f :: F a b
      f = undefined   -- The a:Open comes from instantiating 'undefined'

Note that the kind invariant is maintained by rewriting.
Eg wanted1 rewrites wanted2; if both were compatible kinds before,
   wanted2 will be afterwards.  Similarly givens.

Caveat:
  - Givens from higher-rank, such as:
          type family T b :: * -> * -> *
          type instance T Bool = (->)

          f :: forall a. ((T a ~ (->)) => ...) -> a -> ...
          flop = f (...) True
     Whereas we would be able to apply the type instance, we would not be able to
     use the given (T Bool ~ (->)) in the body of 'flop'


Note [CIrredEvCan constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CIrredEvCan constraints are used for constraints that are "stuck"
   - we can't solve them (yet)
   - we can't use them to solve other constraints
   - but they may become soluble if we substitute for some
     of the type variables in the constraint

Example 1:  (c Int), where c :: * -> Constraint.  We can't do anything
            with this yet, but if later c := Num, *then* we can solve it

Example 2:  a ~ b, where a :: *, b :: k, where k is a kind variable
            We don't want to use this to substitute 'b' for 'a', in case
            'k' is subequently unifed with (say) *->*, because then
            we'd have ill-kinded types floating about.  Rather we want
            to defer using the equality altogether until 'k' get resolved.

Note [Ct/evidence invariant]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  ct :: Ct, then extra fields of 'ct' cache precisely the ctev_pred field
of (cc_ev ct), and is fully rewritten wrt the substitution.   Eg for CDictCan,
   ctev_pred (cc_ev ct) = (cc_class ct) (cc_tyargs ct)
This holds by construction; look at the unique place where CDictCan is
built (in TcCanonical).

In contrast, the type of the evidence *term* (ccev_evtm or ctev_evar) in
the evidence may *not* be fully zonked; we are careful not to look at it
during constraint solving.  See Note [Evidence field of CtEvidence]

{- Note [Dropping derived constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In general we discard derived constraints at the end of constraint solving;
see dropDerivedWC.  For example

 * If we have an unsolved [W] (Ord a), we don't want to complain about
   an unsolved [D] (Eq a) as well.

 * If we have [W] a ~ Int, [W] a ~ Bool, improvement will generate
   [D] Int ~ Bool, and we don't want to report that because it's incomprehensible.
   That is why we don't rewrite wanteds with wanteds!

But (tiresomely) we do keep *some* Derived insolubles:

 * Insoluble kind equalities (e.g. [D] * ~ (* -> *)) may arise from
   a type equality a ~ Int#, say.  In future they'll be Wanted, not Derived,
   but at the moment they are Derived.

 * Insoluble derived equalities (e.g. [D] Int ~ Bool) may arise from
   functional dependency interactions, either between Givens or
   Wanteds.  It seems sensible to retain these:
   - For Givens they reflect unreachable code
   - For Wanteds it is arguably better to get a fundep error than
     a no-instance error (Trac #9612)

Moreover, we keep *all* derived insolubles under some circumstances:

  * They are looked at by simplifyInfer, to decide whether to
    generalise.  Example: [W] a ~ Int, [W] a ~ Bool
    We get [D] Int ~ Bool, and indeed the constraints are insoluble,
    and we want simplifyInfer to see that, even though we don't
    ultimately want to generate an (inexplicable) error message from

To distinguish these cases we use the CtOrigin.

{-
Note [Needed evidence variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Th ic_need_evs field holds the free vars of ic_binds, and all the
ic_binds in nested implications.

  * Main purpose: if one of the ic_givens is not mentioned in here, it
    is redundant.

  * solveImplication may drop an implication altogether if it has no
    remaining 'wanteds'. But we still track the free vars of its
    evidence binds, even though it has now disappeared.

Note [Shadowing in a constraint]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We assume NO SHADOWING in a constraint.  Specifically
 * The unification variables are all implicitly quantified at top
   level, and are all unique
 * The skolem varibles bound in ic_skols are all freah when the
   implication is created.
So we can safely substitute. For example, if we have
   forall a.  a~Int => ...(forall b. ...a...)...
we can push the (a~Int) constraint inwards in the "givens" without
worrying that 'b' might clash.

Note [Skolems in an implication]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The skolems in an implication are not there to perform a skolem escape
check.  That happens because all the environment variables are in the
untouchables, and therefore cannot be unified with anything at all,
let alone the skolems.

Instead, ic_skols is used only when considering floating a constraint
outside the implication in TcSimplify.floatEqualities or
TcSimplify.approximateImplications

Note [Insoluble constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some of the errors that we get during canonicalization are best
reported when all constraints have been simplified as much as
possible. For instance, assume that during simplification the
following constraints arise:

 [Wanted]   F alpha ~  uf1
 [Wanted]   beta ~ uf1 beta

When canonicalizing the wanted (beta ~ uf1 beta), if we eagerly fail
we will simply see a message:
    'Can't construct the infinite type  beta ~ uf1 beta'
and the user has no idea what the uf1 variable is.

Instead our plan is that we will NOT fail immediately, but:
    (1) Record the "frozen" error in the ic_insols field
    (2) Isolate the offending constraint from the rest of the inerts
    (3) Keep on simplifying/canonicalizing

At the end, we will hopefully have substituted uf1 := F alpha, and we
will be able to report a more informative error:
    'Can't construct the infinite type beta ~ F alpha beta'

Insoluble constraints *do* include Derived constraints. For example,
a functional dependency might give rise to [D] Int ~ Bool, and we must
report that.  If insolubles did not contain Deriveds, reportErrors would
never see it.

Note [Evidence field of CtEvidence]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During constraint solving we never look at the type of ctev_evar;
instead we look at the cte_pred field.  The evtm/evar field
may be un-zonked.

Note [Bind new Givens immediately]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For Givens we make new EvVars and bind them immediately. Two main reasons:
  * Gain sharing.  E.g. suppose we start with g :: C a b, where
       class D a => C a b
       class (E a, F a) => D a
    If we generate all g's superclasses as separate EvTerms we might
    get    selD1 (selC1 g) :: E a
           selD2 (selC1 g) :: F a
           selC1 g :: D a
    which we could do more economically as:
           g1 :: D a = selC1 g
           g2 :: E a = selD1 g1
           g3 :: F a = selD2 g1

  * For *coercion* evidence we *must* bind each given:
      class (a~b) => C a b where ....
      f :: C a b => ....
    Then in f's Givens we have g:(C a b) and the superclass sc(g,0):a~b.
    But that superclass selector can't (yet) appear in a coercion
    (see evTermCoercion), so the easy thing is to bind it to an Id.

So a Given has EvVar inside it rather that (as previously) an EvTerm.

{- Note [eqCanRewrite]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(eqCanRewrite ct1 ct2) holds if the constraint ct1 (a CTyEqCan of form
tv ~ ty) can be used to rewrite ct2.  It must satisfy the properties of
a can-rewrite relation, see Definition [Can-rewrite relation]

With the solver handling Coercible constraints like equality constraints,
the rewrite conditions must take role into account, never allowing
a representational equality to rewrite a nominal one.

Note [Wanteds do not rewrite Wanteds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We don't allow Wanteds to rewrite Wanteds, because that can give rise
to very confusing type error messages.  A good example is Trac #8450.
Here's another
   f :: a -> Bool
   f x = ( [x,'c'], [x,True] ) `seq` True
Here we get
  [W] a ~ Char
  [W] a ~ Bool
but we do not want to complain about Bool ~ Char!

Note [Deriveds do rewrite Deriveds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
However we DO allow Deriveds to rewrite Deriveds, because that's how
improvement works; see Note [The improvement story] in TcInteract.

However, for now at least I'm only letting (Derived,NomEq) rewrite
(Derived,NomEq) and not doing anything for ReprEq.  If we have
    eqCanRewriteFR (Derived, NomEq) (Derived, _)  = True
then we lose the property of Note [Can-rewrite relation]
  R2.  If f1 >= f, and f2 >= f,
       then either f1 >= f2 or f2 >= f1
Consider f1 = (Given, ReprEq)
         f2 = (Derived, NomEq)
          f = (Derived, ReprEq)

I thought maybe we could never get Derived ReprEq constraints, but
we can; straight from the Wanteds during improvment. And from a Derived
ReprEq we could conceivably get a Derived NomEq improvment (by decomposing
a type constructor with Nomninal role), and hence unify.

Note [canRewriteOrSame]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
canRewriteOrSame is similar but
 * returns True for Wanted/Wanted.
 * works for all kinds of constraints, not just CTyEqCans
See the call sites for explanations.

Note [SubGoalDepth]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'SubGoalDepth' takes care of stopping the constraint solver from looping.

The counter starts at zero and increases. It includes dictionary constraints,
equality simplification, and type family reduction. (Why combine these? Because
it's actually quite easy to mistake one for another, in sufficiently involved
scenarios, like ConstraintKinds.)

The flag -fcontext-stack=n (not very well named!) fixes the maximium
level.

* The counter includes the depth of type class instance declarations.  Example:
     [W] d{7} : Eq [Int]
  That is d's dictionary-constraint depth is 7.  If we use the instance
     $dfEqList :: Eq a => Eq [a]
  to simplify it, we get
     d{7} = $dfEqList d'{8}
  where d'{8} : Eq Int, and d' has depth 8.

  For civilised (decidable) instance declarations, each increase of
  depth removes a type constructor from the type, so the depth never
  gets big; i.e. is bounded by the structural depth of the type.

* The counter also increments when resolving
equalities involving type functions. Example:
  Assume we have a wanted at depth 7:
    [W] d{7} : F () ~ a
  If thre is an type function equation "F () = Int", this would be rewritten to
    [W] d{8} : Int ~ a
  and remembered as having depth 8.

  Again, without UndecidableInstances, this counter is bounded, but without it
  can resolve things ad infinitum. Hence there is a maximum level.

* Lastly, every time an equality is rewritten, the counter increases. Again,
  rewriting an equality constraint normally makes progress, but it's possible
  the "progress" is just the reduction of an infinitely-reducing type family.
  Hence we need to track the rewrites.

When compiling a program requires a greater depth, then GHC recommends turning
off this check entirely by setting -freduction-depth=0. This is because the
exact number that works is highly variable, and is likely to change even between
minor releases. Because this check is solely to prevent infinite compilation
times, it seems safe to disable it when a user has ascertained that their program
doesn't loop at the type level.
