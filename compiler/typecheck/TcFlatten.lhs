Note [The flattening story]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* A CFunEqCan is either of form
     [G] <F xis> : F xis ~ fsk   -- fsk is a FlatSkol
     [W]       x : F xis ~ fmv   -- fmv is a unification variable,
                                 -- but untouchable,
                                 -- with MetaInfo = FlatMetaTv
  where
     x is the witness variable
     fsk/fmv is a flatten skolem
     xis are function-free
  CFunEqCans are always [Wanted], or [Given], never [Derived]

  fmv untouchable just means that in a CTyVarEq, say,
       fmv ~ Int
  we do NOT unify fmv.

* KEY INSIGHTS:

   - A given flatten-skolem, fsk, is known a-priori to be equal to
     F xis (the LHS), with <F xis> evidence

   - A unification flatten-skolem, fmv, stands for the as-yet-unknown
     type to which (F xis) will eventually reduce

* Inert set invariant: if F xis1 ~ fsk1, F xis2 ~ fsk2
                       then xis1 /= xis2
  i.e. at most one CFunEqCan with a particular LHS

* Each canonical CFunEqCan x : F xis ~ fsk/fmv has its own
  distinct evidence variable x and flatten-skolem fsk/fmv.
  Why? We make a fresh fsk/fmv when the constraint is born;
  and we never rewrite the RHS of a CFunEqCan.

* Function applications can occur in the RHS of a CTyEqCan.  No reason
  not allow this, and it reduces the amount of flattening that must occur.

* Flattening a type (F xis):
    - If we are flattening in a Wanted/Derived constraint
      then create new [W] x : F xis ~ fmv
      else create new [G] x : F xis ~ fsk
      with fresh evidence variable x and flatten-skolem fsk/fmv

    - Add it to the work list

    - Replace (F xis) with fsk/fmv in the type you are flattening

    - You can also add the CFunEqCan to the "flat cache", which
      simply keeps track of all the function applications you
      have flattened.

    - If (F xis) is in the cache already, just
      use its fsk/fmv and evidence x, and emit nothing.

    - No need to substitute in the flat-cache. It's not the end
      of the world if we start with, say (F alpha ~ fmv1) and
      (F Int ~ fmv2) and then find alpha := Int.  Athat will
      simply give rise to fmv1 := fmv2 via [Interacting rule] below

* Canonicalising a CFunEqCan [G/W] x : F xis ~ fsk/fmv
    - Flatten xis (to substitute any tyvars; there are already no functions)
                  cos :: xis ~ flat_xis
    - New wanted  x2 :: F flat_xis ~ fsk/fmv
    - Add new wanted to flat cache
    - Discharge x = F cos ; x2

* Unification flatten-skolems, fmv, ONLY get unified when either
    a) The CFunEqCan takes a step, using an axiom
    b) During un-flattening
  They are never unified in any other form of equality.
  For example [W] ffmv ~ Int  is stuck; it does not unify with fmv.

* We *never* substitute in the RHS (i.e. the fsk/fmv) of a CFunEqCan.
  That would destroy the invariant about the shape of a CFunEqCan,
  and it would risk wanted/wanted interactions. The only way we
  learn information about fsk is when the CFunEqCan takes a step.

  However we *do* substitute in the LHS of a CFunEqCan (else it
  would never get to fire!)

* [Interacting rule]
    (inert)     [W] x1 : F tys ~ fmv1
    (work item) [W] x2 : F tys ~ fmv2
  Just solve one from the other:
    x2 := x1
    fmv2 := fmv1
  This just unites the two fsks into one.
  Always solve given from wanted if poss.

* [Firing rule: wanteds]
    (work item) [W] x : F tys ~ fmv
    instantiate axiom: ax_co : F tys ~ rhs

   Dischard fmv:
      fmv := alpha
      x := ax_co ; sym x2
      [W] x2 : alpha ~ rhs  (Non-canonical)
   discharging the work item. This is the way that fmv's get
   unified; even though they are "untouchable".

   NB: this deals with the case where fmv appears in xi, which can
   happen; it just happens through the non-canonical stuff

   Possible short cut (shortCutReduction) if rhs = G rhs_tys,
   where G is a type function.  Then
      - Flatten rhs_tys (cos : rhs_tys ~ rhs_xis)
      - Add G rhs_xis ~ fmv to flat cache
      - New wanted [W] x2 : G rhs_xis ~ fmv
      - Discharge x := co ; G cos ; x2

* [Firing rule: givens]
    (work item) [G] g : F tys ~ fsk
    instantiate axiom: co : F tys ~ rhs

   Now add non-canonical (since rhs is not flat)
      [G] (sym g ; co) : fsk ~ rhs

   Short cut (shortCutReduction) for when rhs = G rhs_tys and G is a type function
      [G] (co ; g) : G tys ~ fsk
   But need to flatten tys:  flat_cos : tys ~ flat_tys
      [G] (sym (G flat_cos) ; co ; g) : G flat_tys ~ fsk


Why given-fsks, alone, doesn't work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Could we get away with only flatten meta-tyvars, with no flatten-skolems? No.

  [W] w : alpha ~ [F alpha Int]

---> flatten
  w = ...w'...
  [W] w' : alpha ~ [fsk]
  [G] <F alpha Int> : F alpha Int ~ fsk

--> unify (no occurs check)
  alpha := [fsk]

But since fsk = F alpha Int, this is really an occurs check error.  If
that is all we know about alpha, we will succeed in constraint
solving, producing a program with an infinite type.

Even if we did finally get (g : fsk ~ Boo)l by solving (F alpha Int ~ fsk)
using axiom, zonking would not see it, so (x::alpha) sitting in the
tree will get zonked to an infinite type.  (Zonking always only does
refl stuff.)

Why flatten-meta-vars, alone doesn't work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look at Simple13, with unification-fmvs only

  [G] g : a ~ [F a]

---> Flatten given
  g' = g;[x]
  [G] g'  : a ~ [fmv]
  [W] x : F a ~ fmv

--> subst a in x
       x = F g' ; x2
   [W] x2 : F [fmv] ~ fmv

And now we have an evidence cycle between g' and x!

If we used a given instead (ie current story)

  [G] g : a ~ [F a]

---> Flatten given
  g' = g;[x]
  [G] g'  : a ~ [fsk]
  [G] <F a> : F a ~ fsk

---> Substitute for a
  [G] g'  : a ~ [fsk]
  [G] F (sym g'); <F a> : F [fsk] ~ fsk


Why is it right to treat fmv's differently to ordinary unification vars?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  f :: forall a. a -> a -> Bool
  g :: F Int -> F Int -> Bool

Consider
  f (x:Int) (y:Bool)
This gives alpha~Int, alpha~Bool.  There is an inconsistency,
but really only one error.  SherLoc may tell you which location
is most likely, based on other occurrences of alpha.

Consider
  g (x:Int) (y:Bool)
Here we get (F Int ~ Int, F Int ~ Bool), which flattens to
  (fmv ~ Int, fmv ~ Bool)
But there are really TWO separate errors.  We must not complain
about Int~Bool.  Moreover these two errors could arise in entirely
unrelated parts of the code.  (In the alpha case, there must be
*some* connection (eg v:alpha in common envt).)

Note [Orient equalities with flatten-meta-vars on the left]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example comes from IndTypesPerfMerge

From the ambiguity check for
  f :: (F a ~ a) => a
we get:
      [G] F a ~ a
      [W] F alpha ~ alpha, alpha ~ a

    From Givens we get
      [G] F a ~ fsk, fsk ~ a

    Now if we flatten we get
      [W] alpha ~ fmv, F alpha ~ fmv, alpha ~ a

    Now, processing the first one first, choosing alpha := fmv
      [W] F fmv ~ fmv, fmv ~ a

    And now we are stuck.  We must either *unify* fmv := a, or
    use the fmv ~ a to rewrite F fmv ~ fmv, so we can make it
    meet up with the given F a ~ blah.

Solution: always put fmvs on the left, so we get
      [W] fmv ~ alpha, F alpha ~ fmv, alpha ~ a
  The point is that fmvs are very uninformative, so doing alpha := fmv
  is a bad idea.  We want to use other constraints on alpha first.


Note [Derived constraints from wanted CTyEqCans]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Is this type ambiguous:  (Foo e ~ Maybe e) => Foo e
 (indexed-types/should_fail/T4093a)

 [G] Foo e ~ Maybe e
 [W] Foo e ~ Foo ee      -- ee is a unification variable
 [W] Foo ee ~ Maybe ee)
---
 [G] Foo e ~ fsk
 [G] fsk ~ Maybe e

 [W] Foo e ~ fmv1
 [W] Foo ee ~ fmv2
 [W] fmv1 ~ fmv2
 [W] fmv2 ~ Maybe ee

--->   fmv1 := fsk  by matching LHSs
 [W] Foo ee ~ fmv2
 [W] fsk ~ fmv2
 [W] fmv2 ~ Maybe ee

--->
 [W] Foo ee ~ fmv2
 [W] fmv2 ~ Maybe e
 [W] fmv2 ~ Maybe ee

Now maybe we shuld get [D] e ~ ee, and then we'd solve it entirely.
But if in a smilar situation we got [D] Int ~ Bool we'd be back
to complaining about wanted/wanted interactions.  Maybe this arises
also for fundeps?

Here's another example:
  f :: [a] -> [b] -> blah
  f (e1 :: F Int) (e2 :: F Int)

  we get
     F Int ~ fmv
     fmv ~ [alpha]
     fmv ~ [beta]

  We want: alpha := beta (which might unlock something else).  If we
  generated [D] [alpha] ~ [beta] we'd be good here.

Current story: we don't generate these derived constraints.  We could, but
we'd want to make them very weak, so we didn't get the Int~Bool complaint.

Try: rewrite wanted with wanted only for fmvs (not all meta-tyvars)

But:   fmv ~ alpha[0]
       alpha[0] ~ fmv’
Now we don’t see that fmv ~ fmv’, which is a problem for injectivity detection.

Conclusion: rewrite wanteds with wanted for all untouchables.

skol ~ untch, must re-orieint to untch ~ skol, so that we can use it to rewrite.

F a ~ Int, where (F a) is not reducible.


----------------------------------------
indexed_types/should_fail/T8227:

Why using a different can-rewrite rule in CFunEqCan heads
does not work.

Assuming NOT rewriting wanteds with wanteds

   Inert: [W] fsk_aBh ~ fmv_aBk -> fmv_aBk
          [W] fmv_aBk ~ fsk_aBh

          [G] Scalar fsk_aBg ~ fsk_aBh
          [G] V a ~ f_aBg

   Worklist includes  [W] Scalar fmv_aBi ~ fmv_aBk
   fmv_aBi, fmv_aBk are flatten unificaiton variables

   Work item: [W] V fsk_aBh ~ fmv_aBi

Note that the inert wanteds are cyclic, because we do not rewrite
wanteds with wanteds.


Then we go into a loop when normalise the work-item, because we
use rewriteOrSame on the argument of V.

Conclusion: Don't make canRewrite context specific; instead use 
[W] a ~ ty to rewrite a wanted iff 'a' is a unification variable.


----------------------------------------

Here is a somewhat similar case:

   type family G a :: *

   blah :: (G a ~ Bool, Eq (G a)) => a -> a
   blah = error "urk"

   foo x = blah x

For foo we get
   [W] Eq (G a), G a ~ Bool
Flattening
   [W] G a ~ fmv, Eq fmv, fmv ~ Bool
We can't simplify away the Eq Bool unless we substitute for fmv.
Maybe that doesn't matter: we would still be left with unsolved
G a ~ Bool.

--------------------------
Trac #9318 has a very simple program leading to

  [W] F Int ~ Int
  [W] F Int ~ Bool

We don't want to get "Error Int~Bool".  But if fmv's can rewrite
wanteds, we will

  [W] fmv ~ Int
  [W] fmv ~ Bool
--->
  [W] Int ~ Bool

Note [Flattening]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  flatten ty  ==>   (xi, cc)
    where
      xi has no type functions, unless they appear under ForAlls

      cc = Auxiliary given (equality) constraints constraining
           the fresh type variables in xi.  Evidence for these
           is always the identity coercion, because internally the
           fresh flattening skolem variables are actually identified
           with the types they have been generated to stand in for.

Note that it is flatten's job to flatten *every type function it sees*.
flatten is only called on *arguments* to type functions, by canEqGiven.

Recall that in comments we use alpha[flat = ty] to represent a
flattening skolem variable alpha which has been generated to stand in
for ty.

----- Example of flattening a constraint: ------
  flatten (List (F (G Int)))  ==>  (xi, cc)
    where
      xi  = List alpha
      cc  = { G Int ~ beta[flat = G Int],
              F beta ~ alpha[flat = F beta] }
Here
  * alpha and beta are 'flattening skolem variables'.
  * All the constraints in cc are 'given', and all their coercion terms
    are the identity.

NB: Flattening Skolems only occur in canonical constraints, which
are never zonked, so we don't need to worry about zonking doing
accidental unflattening.

Note that we prefer to leave type synonyms unexpanded when possible,
so when the flattener encounters one, it first asks whether its
transitive expansion contains any type function applications.  If so,
it expands the synonym and proceeds; if not, it simply returns the
unexpanded synonym.

Note [Flattening synonyms]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Not expanding synonyms aggressively improves error messages, and
keeps types smaller. But we need to take care.

Suppose
   type T a = a -> a
and we want to flatten the type (T (F a)).  Then we can safely flatten
the (F a) to a skolem, and return (T fsk).  We don't need to expand the
synonym.  This works because TcTyConAppCo can deal with synonyms
(unlike TyConAppCo), see Note [TcCoercions] in TcEvidence.

But (Trac #8979) for
   type T a = (F a, a)    where F is a type function
we must expand the synonym in (say) T Int, to expose the type function
to the flattener.


Note [Flattening under a forall]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Under a forall, we
  (a) MUST apply the inert substitution
  (b) MUST NOT flatten type family applications
Hence FMSubstOnly.

For (a) consider   c ~ a, a ~ T (forall b. (b, [c])
If we don't apply the c~a substitution to the second constraint
we won't see the occurs-check error.

For (b) consider  (a ~ forall b. F a b), we don't want to flatten
to     (a ~ forall b.fsk, F a b ~ fsk)
because now the 'b' has escaped its scope.  We'd have to flatten to
       (a ~ forall b. fsk b, forall b. F a b ~ fsk b)
and we have not begun to think about how to make that work!

Note [Applying the inert substitution]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The inert CTyEqCans (a ~ ty), inert_eqs, can be treated as a
substitution, and indeed flattenTyVarOuter applies it to the type
being flattened.  It has the following properties:

 * 'a' is not in fvs(ty)
 * They are *inert*; that is the eqCanRewrite relation is everywhere false

An example of such an inert substitution is:

 [G] g1 : ta8 ~ ta4
 [W] g2 : ta4 ~ a5Fj

If you ignored the G/W, it would not be an idempotent, but we don't ignore
it.  When rewriting a constraint
    ev_work :: blah
we only rewrite it with an inert constraint
    ev_inert1 :: a ~ ty
if
    ev_inert1 `eqCanRewrite` ev_work

This process stops in exactly one step; that is, the RHS 'ty' cannot be further
rewritten by any other inert.  Why not?  If it could, we'd have
    ev_inert1 :: a ~ ty[b]
    ev_inert2 :: b ~ ty'
and
    ev_inert2 `canRewrite` ev_work
But by the EqCanRewrite Property (see Note [eqCanRewrite]), that means
that ev_inert2 `eqCanRewrite` ev_inert1; but that means that 'b' can't
appear free in ev_inert1's RHS.

When we *unify* a variable, which we write
  alpha := ty
we must be sure we aren't creating an infinite type.  But that comes
from the CTyEqCan invariant that 'a' not in fvs(ty), plus the fact that
an inert CTyEqCan is fully zonked wrt the current unification assignments.
In effect they become Givens, implemented via the side-effected substitution.

Note [An alternative story for the inert substitution]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We used (GHC 7.8) to have this story for the inert substitution inert_eqs

 * 'a' is not in fvs(ty)
 * They are *inert* in the weaker sense that there is no infinite chain of
   (i1 `eqCanRewrite` i2), (i2 `eqCanRewrite` i3), etc

This means that flattening must be recursive, but it does allow
  [G] a ~ [b]
  [G] b ~ Maybe c

This avoids "saturating" the Givens, which can save a modest amount of work.
It is easy to implement, in TcInteract.kick_out, by only kicking out an inert
only if (a) the work item can rewrite the inert AND
        (b) the inert cannot rewrite the work item

This is signifcantly harder to think about. It can save a LOT of work
in occurs-check cases, but we don't care about them much.  Trac #5837
is an example; all the constraints here are Givens

             [G] a ~ TF (a,Int)
    -->
    work     TF (a,Int) ~ fsk
    inert    fsk ~ a

    --->
    work     fsk ~ (TF a, TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ a

    --->
    work     a ~ (TF a, TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ a

    ---> (attempting to flatten (TF a) so that it does not mention a
    work     TF a ~ fsk2
    inert    a ~ (fsk2, TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ (fsk2, TF Int)

    ---> (substitute for a)
    work     TF (fsk2, TF Int) ~ fsk2
    inert    a ~ (fsk2, TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ (fsk2, TF Int)

    ---> (top-level reduction, re-orient)
    work     fsk2 ~ (TF fsk2, TF Int)
    inert    a ~ (fsk2, TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ (fsk2, TF Int)

    ---> (attempt to flatten (TF fsk2) to get rid of fsk2
    work     TF fsk2 ~ fsk3
    work     fsk2 ~ (fsk3, TF Int)
    inert    a   ~ (fsk2, TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ (fsk2, TF Int)

    --->
    work     TF fsk2 ~ fsk3
    inert    fsk2 ~ (fsk3, TF Int)
    inert    a   ~ ((fsk3, TF Int), TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ ((fsk3, TF Int), TF Int)

Because the incoming given rewrites all the inert givens, we get more and
more duplication in the inert set.  But this really only happens in pathalogical
casee, so we don't care.


\begin{code}
eqCanRewrite :: CtEvidence -> CtEvidence -> Bool
-- Very important function!
-- See Note [eqCanRewrite]
eqCanRewrite (CtGiven {})   _              = True
eqCanRewrite (CtDerived {}) (CtDerived {}) = True  -- Derived can't solve wanted/given
eqCanRewrite _ _ = False

canRewriteOrSame :: CtEvidence -> CtEvidence -> Bool
-- See Note [canRewriteOrSame]
canRewriteOrSame (CtGiven {})   _              = True
canRewriteOrSame (CtWanted {})  (CtWanted {})  = True
canRewriteOrSame (CtWanted {})  (CtDerived {}) = True
canRewriteOrSame (CtDerived {}) (CtDerived {}) = True
canRewriteOrSame _ _ = False
\end{code}

Note [eqCanRewrite]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(eqCanRewrite ct1 ct2) holds if the constraint ct1 (a CTyEqCan of form
tv ~ ty) can be used to rewrite ct2.

The EqCanRewrite Property:
  * For any a,b in {G,W,D}  if   a canRewrite b
                            then a canRewrite a
  This is what guarantees that canonicalisation will terminate.
  See Note [Applying the inert substitution]

At the moment we don't allow Wanteds to rewrite Wanteds, because that can give
rise to very confusing type error messages.  A good example is Trac #8450.
Here's another
   f :: a -> Bool
   f x = ( [x,'c'], [x,True] ) `seq` True
Here we get
  [W] a ~ Char
  [W] a ~ Bool
but we do not want to complain about Bool ~ Char!

Note [canRewriteOrSame]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
canRewriteOrSame is similar but
 * returns True for Wanted/Wanted.
 * works for all kinds of constraints, not just CTyEqCans
See the call sites for explanations.

Note [Unflatten using funeqs first]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    [W] G a ~ Int
    [W] F (G a) ~ G a

do not want to end up with
    [W} F Int ~ Int
because that might actually hold!  Better to end up with the two above
unsolved constraints.  The flat form will be

    G a ~ fmv1     (CFunEqCan)
    F fmv1 ~ fmv2  (CFunEqCan)
    fmv1 ~ Int     (CTyEqCan)
    fmv1 ~ fmv2    (CTyEqCan)

Flatten using the fun-eqs first.
